1
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,880
Montauk train on track "B."

2
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:39,280
Random thoughts
for Valentine's Day, 2004.

3
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:43,600
Today is a holiday invented
by greeting card companies...

4
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,600
Last call...

5
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,160
to make people
feel like crap.

6
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,840
I ditched work today.

7
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,280
Took a train out to Montauk.

8
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:59,040
Montauk train boarding
on track "B."

9
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:01,720
I don't know why.

10
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:04,960
Aah!
I'm not an impulsive person.

11
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:16,360
I guess I just woke up
in a funk this morning.

12
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,760
I gotta get my car fixed.

13
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,760
Hi. Cindy?

14
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,240
It's Joel. Joel!

15
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:27,280
Listen, I don't
feel very well today.

16
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,280
No, food poisoning,
I think.

17
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,840
It's goddamn freezing on this beach.

18
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:35,480
Montauk in February.
Brilliant, Joel.

19
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:40,200
Page is ripped out.

20
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:42,800
Don't remember doing that.

21
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,920
It appears this is
my fixirst entry in two years.

22
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,720
Sand is overrated.

23
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,920
It's just tiny little rocks.

24
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:14,240
If only I could
meet someone new.

25
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:18,160
I guess my chances of that happening
are somewhat diminished,

26
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:22,840
seeing that I'm incapable
of making eye contact
with a woman I don't know.

27
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:27,120
Maybe I should
get back together with Naomi.

28
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,880
She was nice.
Nice is good.

29
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,440
She loved me.

30
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:14,560
Why do I fall in love
with every woman I see...

31
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:17,520
who shows me
the least bit of attention?

32
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,600
Hi.

33
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,560
I'm sorry?

34
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:05,320
- I just said hi.
- Hi. Hello. Hi.

35
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:09,040
Okay if I sit closer?

36
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:12,120
How far are you going?

37
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,440
Uh, Rockville Center.

38
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:16,840
Get out! Me too!

39
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,840
Really?
What are the odds?

40
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,040
Do I know you?

41
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,800
Do you ever shop
at Barnes & Noble?

42
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,000
Sure. Sure.
That's it!

43
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,440
Yeah?
I've seen you, man!

44
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:37,680
Book slave there
for, like, five years now.

45
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:41,120
Ah. I would have thought
I would've remembered you.
Jesus! Is it five years?

46
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,280
It might be the hair.

47
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,480
What might?
It changes a lot.

48
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:48,840
The color.
That's why you might not
recognize me.

49
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:52,600
It's called Blue Ruin,
the color.
Right. Yeah.

50
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:55,000
Snappy name, huh?
I like it.

51
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:57,480
Yeah.

52
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:00,640
Anyway, this company
makes a whole line of colors
with equally snappy names.

53
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:05,160
Red... Red Menace,
Yellow Fever,
Green Revolution.

54
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:08,160
That'd be a job,
coming up with those names.

55
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,200
You think there could
possibly be a job like that?

56
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:14,760
I mean, how many hair colors
could there be? Fifty, maybe.

57
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:16,880
Someone's got that job.

58
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:22,000
Agent Orange!
I came up with that one.

59
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,960
I apply my personality
in a paste.

60
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,960
Oh, I doubt that very much.

61
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:29,520
Well, you don't know me,
so...

62
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,720
you don't know, do you?

63
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:38,960
Sorry. I was just...
I'm trying to be nice.

64
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,800
Yeah. I got it.

65
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:05,320
My name's Clementine,
by the way.
I'm Joel.

66
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,720
Hi, Joel.
Hey.

67
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:10,280
No jokes about my name.

68
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:13,680
Oh, no, you wouldn't do that.
You're trying to be nice.

69
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:17,680
I don't know any jokes
about your name.

70
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:19,920
Huckleberry Hound.

71
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,560
I don't know what that means.

72
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:25,760
Huckleberry Hound?
What are you, nuts?

73
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,760
It's been suggested.

74
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,920
Oh, my darlin', oh, my darlin'
Oh, my darlin' Clementine

75
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,080
You were lost
and gone forever

76
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,680
Dreadful sorry
Clementine

77
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,720
No?

78
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:41,720
I'm sorry. Just...
It's a pretty name, though.
It really is nice.

79
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,760
It's, uh...
It means "merciful."

80
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,760
Right? Clemency?

81
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,040
Although it hardly fits.

82
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,400
I'm a vindictive little bitch,
truth be told.

83
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:52,920
Gee, l-I wouldn't
think that about you.

84
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,200
Why wouldn't you
think that about me?
I don't know.

85
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,480
I just...

86
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,880
I don't know.
I just, uh...

87
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,880
You seem nice, so...

88
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,000
Oh, now I'm nice?

89
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:08,240
Oh, God. Don't you know
any other adjectives?

90
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:10,240
I don't need "nice."

91
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:14,280
I don't need myself to be it,
and I don't need anybody else to be it at me.
Okay.

92
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,120
Joel?

93
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,480
It's Joel, right?

94
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,000
Yes.

95
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:27,480
I'm sorry I yelled at you.

96
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:31,040
I'm a little out of sorts today.

97
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:41,640
My embarrassing admission is,

98
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:44,640
I really like
that you're nice right now.

99
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:49,520
I mean, I can't tell
from one moment to the next
what I'm gonna like,

100
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,600
but right now...

101
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:54,720
I'm glad you are.

102
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:06,120
I have so much stuff
that, uh, I probably should, uh...

103
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,280
Oh! I'm sorry. Okay.
L-I'm writing, and...

104
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:12,440
No, no. I just...
Sure. No. That's okay.

105
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:15,120
I just have...
You know, this is...
Okay.

106
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,600
- Ohh! Hey!
- Take care, then.

107
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,680
Jesus!

108
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:36,920
Hi. I could, uh,
give you a ride, if you need.

109
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,920
It's cold.

110
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,880
Yeah. Okay. Yeah.
Yeah?

111
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,880
It is frosty.

112
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:45,720
You're not a stalker
or anything, right?
I'm not a stalker.

113
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,880
You're the one that talked to me.
Remember?

114
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:50,240
That is the oldest trick
in the stalker book.

115
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,440
Really?
There's a stalker book?

116
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:54,720
Mm-hmm.
Okay.

117
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:57,120
I gotta read that one.

118
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:06,600
Look, I'm sorry if I came off
sorta nutso. I'm not, really.

119
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:10,080
Oh, it's okay.
I didn't think you were.

120
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:18,800
Did you wanna have a drink?

121
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:21,040
I have lots of drinks,
and I could, um...

122
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,080
Um...

123
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,080
Never mind.

124
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,520
Sorry. That was stupid.
I'm embarrassed now.
No, no, no, no.

125
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,560
Good night, Joel.

126
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:51,160
Two Blue Ruins.

127
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,960
Thank you.

128
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:55,960
Drink up, young man.

129
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:58,840
It'll make
the whole seduction part
less repugnant.

130
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,080
I'm just kidding!

131
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,120
Come on.

132
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:14,080
You're kinda closed-mouthed,
aren't you?

133
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,080
I'm sorry.

134
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:20,640
It's just, you know,
my life isn't that interesting.

135
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,320
I go to work, I come home.

136
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:27,880
Don't know what to say.

137
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,920
You should read my journal.

138
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:34,480
I mean, it's just... blank.

139
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:37,760
Really?
Does that make you
sad or anxious?

140
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:41,160
I mean, I'm always anxious,
thinking I'm not living
my life to the fullest,

141
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:43,200
taking advantage
of every possibility,

142
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:47,200
making sure
I'm not wasting one second
of the little time I have.

143
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:49,760
I think about that.
Yeah?

144
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,120
You're really nice.

145
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:59,040
Ohh!
God, I have to
stop saying that.

146
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:03,240
I'm gonna marry you.

147
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:05,240
I know it.

148
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:07,480
Um... okay.

149
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:17,160
Joel, you should come up
to the Charles with me sometime.

150
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,160
It gets frozen this time of year.

151
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,360
That sounds scary.
Exactly.

152
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,400
I'll pack a picnic.

153
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:27,360
A night picnic.
Night picnics are different.

154
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,240
And, um, we could...

155
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:31,280
Sounds good.

156
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,920
But I... I should, uh, go.
Now.

157
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,920
You should stay.

158
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,240
No, I really... I'm... I...

159
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:41,240
I have to get up so early.

160
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:43,240
I would like you
to call me.

161
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:46,080
Would you do that?
I would like it.

162
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,120
Yes.

163
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:54,400
Wish me a happy Valentine's Day
when you call!

164
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,360
That'd be nice.

165
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,080
What took you so long?

166
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,080
I just walked in.

167
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,720
Mm-hmm. You miss me?

168
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:46,040
Yeah.
Oddly enough, I do.

169
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:48,040
Oh!

170
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:51,040
You said "I do."
I guess that means were married.

171
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,040
I guess so.

172
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,600
Tomorrow night?
Honeymoon on ice?

173
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:58,080
It's really solid
this time of year.

174
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:00,000
Whoa! I don't know.

175
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:02,000
Come on.
Come on.
Eee!

176
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:04,040
Come on.
Come on, come on.

177
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:07,520
Whew.

178
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:11,080
Oh. So beautiful.

179
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,280
Isn't it?

180
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:19,280
Uh, don't go too far.

181
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:22,120
- Whoo! Oww! Ow!
- Whoa! Oh!

182
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:25,360
- Are you okay?
- Ouch! Fuck it.

183
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:29,160
Ohh! Oh, my ass!

184
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:34,160
I think I should go back.
Come on. Come on!

185
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,160
What if it breaks?

186
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:39,160
- "What if"?
Do you really care right now?
- Huh?

187
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:41,400
Come here. Please.

188
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:43,200
Come on.

189
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,480
Ohh.
Ooh-hoo-hoo-hoo!

190
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:51,520
Slidy-slidy.
Slidy-slidy.
Whoa!

191
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:54,840
This is good.
Here, let me show you
this one thing.

192
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:57,000
What are you doing?
Whoa.

193
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,400
Come on.

194
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,320
Think I heard a crack.

195
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:12,160
It's not gonna crack
or break or...

196
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,200
It's so thick.

197
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:18,480
Show me which constellations
you know.

198
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:21,160
Um... Oh.

199
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:23,880
I don't... know any.

200
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:27,600
Show me
which ones you know.

201
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:30,080
Okay.

202
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,720
Okay.

203
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:36,280
Oh. Here's Osidius.

204
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:38,280
Where?

205
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:40,280
Right there.
See?

206
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:43,160
Sort of a swoop
and a cross.

207
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:45,160
Osidius the Emphatic.

208
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:49,600
You're full of shit.
Right?
Nope.

209
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:52,600
Osidius is right there.
Swoop and cross.

210
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:55,720
Shut the fuck up!

211
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,800
Clementine.

212
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:11,120
Cock-a-doodle-doo.

213
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:15,640
Hey.
Hey.

214
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:18,800
Hey.
Sorry to wake you,
but we're... here.

215
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:22,960
Ahh.

216
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,880
Can I come over
to your house...

217
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:33,640
to sleep?

218
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:36,560
I'm so tired.

219
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:39,440
Okay. Um, yeah. Sure.

220
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:42,400
Let me get my toothbrush.
Yeah. Oh.

221
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:46,760
Just...

222
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:05,240
Yes?

223
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:09,760
Can I help you?
What do you mean?

224
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:13,280
Can I help you with something?

225
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:15,960
No.

226
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:18,360
What are you doing here?

227
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,960
I'm not really sure
what you're asking me.

228
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,680
Oh.

229
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,680
Thanks.

230
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:43,200
I need your lovin'

231
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:50,360
Like the sunshine

232
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:58,000
Everybody's gotta learn sometime

233
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:05,520
Everybody's gotta learn sometime

234
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:11,680
Everybody's gotta learn sometime

235
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:16,840
We're looking for 159.
What number's that?

236
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,840
I don't know where that is.

237
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:21,840
Jesus Christ, you'd think
they'd light the number,
or at least put a number on...

238
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:23,840
Is that him?
I think so.

239
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:27,000
Yeah, that's him.
Wait. That's him.

240
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:44,280
Hey, Joel.
Frank.

241
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:49,200
Oh, shit.

242
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:53,720
Jesus. The only
Valentine's Day cards I get
are from my mother.

243
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,720
How pathetic is that, huh?

244
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,720
You're lucky
you have Clementine, man.

245
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,720
She is way cool.

246
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:02,280
Hey, you got any big
Valentine's Day plans with her?

247
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,280
No.

248
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:10,280
Well, it's only a day away.
Better make some reservations
or something.

249
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:12,480
Don't want to end up
at Mickey D's. Right?

250
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:14,480
McRomance!

251
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:17,000
You want some fries
with that shake?

252
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:19,400
I have to, uh,
go to sleep now, Frank.

253
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:21,640
It's 8:30.

254
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:52,200
Patrick, stop it.

255
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:11,480
Ohh! Okay.

256
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:14,000
Okay. Okay.

257
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:17,400
Whew. Okay.

258
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:21,480
Showtime at the Apollo.

259
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:33,360
Shh, shh, shh. Hey.

260
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,560
Quiet.

261
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,560
Hey, Joel. What's up?

262
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,560
Oh. Hi, Frank.

263
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:01,880
I only get Valentine's Day cards
from my mom.

264
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:04,920
How pathetic is that?

265
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,920
You're lucky
you have Clementine, Joel.

266
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:10,920
Hey, you got, uh, any, uh, big
Valentine's Day plans with her?

267
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,920
No.

268
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,920
It's only a day away.

269
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,400
Better make a reservation
or something.

270
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:19,400
Don't wanna end up
at Mickey D's.

271
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:21,960
Oh, no!

272
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:25,320
Yes! Valentine's Day
is three goddamn days away!
I want it resolved.

273
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:28,520
I'm willing to be
the one to resolve it.

274
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:31,920
So I call her,
and she's changed her number.

275
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,080
So I walked over to Antic Attic,
you know, to get her something.

276
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:39,120
I thought I'd go over to work,
give her an early valentine, and...

277
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:42,760
You won't believe it.

278
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:45,560
She's there with...

279
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:49,360
this guy,
this really young guy.

280
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:52,880
And she looks at me like
she doesn't even know who I am.

281
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:55,400
Excuse me?

282
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:58,120
Can I help you
find something, sir?

283
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:04,000
Hey, Clem-ato.

284
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:07,120
Patrick! Baby boy.

285
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:12,400
What you doing here, baby?
Just came to surprise you.

286
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:15,360
Let me know
if you need something, sir.
You look good.

287
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:17,360
Hi.

288
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:20,520
How are you?
Pretty good.
Pretty bored. Pretty tired.

289
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:22,560
Uh-huh.

290
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:25,760
I so want what's in your suit.
Oh, good.

291
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,280
Why?

292
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:40,840
Why would she do that to me?

293
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:47,280
Hey, does anybody want a joint?

294
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:49,920
Oh, God, Rob, give it a rest.

295
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,960
Oh, God.
She's punishing me.

296
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,960
I know, honey.
For being honest.

297
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,280
It's horrible.
I should just go to her house.

298
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:59,280
No! No, no, no.
You don't wanna go there, man.
You don't wanna go there.

299
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:01,720
Get off. It's too...

300
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,720
Right.
Yeah.

301
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:05,720
I don't want to seem desperate.

302
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:10,400
Joel, why don't you just see this as a sign,
make a clean break. Right?

303
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:13,600
Right?

304
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:17,720
All right, Joel,
look, man, seriously.

305
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:19,720
Rob!
Here's the deal.

306
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:22,960
Don't do that.
Rob, what are you doing?
No, no, no, no.

307
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:26,200
What's your fucking suggestion, Carrie?
What's your brilliant, reasoned solution?

308
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:28,800
You're gonna make this
about our shit now?
This isn't about us.

309
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:32,960
I agree. It's not about us.
It's aboutJoel, who's an adult.
Okay?

310
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Not Mama Carrie's kid.

311
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:39,240
- What are you...
- That's your laundry!

312
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:44,200
That's great.
That's good.

313
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,240
Okay.

314
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:07,440
What is it?
I don't know.
It's some place that does a thing.

315
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:21,360
Good morning. Lacuna.

316
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:25,360
No, I'm sorry.
That offer expired
after the new year.

317
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:31,280
Yeah, sure.
We can fit you in...

318
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:33,640
How about on the fifth?

319
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:37,120
That's a Wednesday.
All right, great.
Could you spell that, please?

320
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:41,720
Okay, and we'll need
a daytime phone number.

321
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:45,400
Great. Have a nice day.
See you then.

322
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,400
May I help you?

323
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:50,400
I'm Joel Barish.
Excuse me?

324
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:54,040
I'm Joel. Barish.
I have an appointment with Dr...

325
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:56,040
Mierzwiak.

326
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:59,400
- Here. Could you please fill this out?
- I just want to talk to him.

327
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:01,480
You still need to
fill the form out, sir.
Really?

328
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:04,640
- Thank you.
Great.

329
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,640
I don't have a pen.

330
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:09,800
There's a pen right there.

331
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:11,800
Good morning. Lacuna.
Oh.

332
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:15,760
Oh, yeah, that offer. That's done now.
That expired after the new year.

333
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,800
Mr. Barish?

334
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:22,120
How are we today?

335
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:24,120
Not too good, actually.

336
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:26,120
Boo!
Oh, my God! Stan!

337
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:29,120
Sorry.
Sorry, I was just...
I'm working!

338
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:32,480
Sorry. Sorry.

339
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:34,560
Here, Doctor.
Thank you.

340
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:37,520
You should not
have seen this.

341
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:39,560
I apologize.

342
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,880
This is a hoax, right?
I mean, this is Clem...

343
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:48,800
I assure you, no.
No.

344
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:56,960
Mm-mmm.
There's no such thing as this.

345
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:01,680
Look, our files are confidential,
Mr. Barish,

346
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:04,200
so I can't show you evidence.

347
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:10,000
Suffice it to say that Miss, uh...
Miss Kruczynski was not happy,

348
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,120
and she wanted to move on.

349
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:14,160
We provide that possibility.

350
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:18,280
"Miss Kruczynski was not happy
and wanted to move on.

351
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:20,880
We provide
that possibility."

352
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,880
What the hell is that?

353
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:25,880
Nicest guy
she ever went out with.

354
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:27,880
Oww! Fuck!

355
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:30,400
God, Rob! Give it a rest!

356
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,400
It's okay.
It's all right.

357
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:35,160
Carrie, I am making
a birdhouse.

358
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:40,920
What can I say, Joel?
You know Clementine. She's like that.

359
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,800
She's impulsive.

360
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:46,440
She decided to erase you
almost as a lark.

361
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:52,280
A lark.

362
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:55,800
Why? Why? Why?
Why did you do that?

363
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:01,120
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

364
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:04,120
I'm sorry, Doctor.
He just barged right in here.

365
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:07,200
Okay. I want it done.
I told him pre-Valentine's Day
is our busy time.

366
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:10,640
- Oh, th-th-that's... that's okay, Mary.
- But there are people waiting.

367
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:13,640
Mr. Barish, if you'd like to, uh...
to come inside.

368
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:17,280
And, Mary, if you could take care of Mrs. Woo.
Good-bye, Mrs. Woo.
Yes, of course.

369
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:24,000
Now, the, uh...

370
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:27,000
the first thing
we need you to do, Mr. Barish,

371
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:29,000
is to go home...

372
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:34,520
and collect everything you own
that has some association with Clementine.

373
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:36,840
Anything.

374
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:42,520
And we'll use these items to create
a map of Clementine in your brain.

375
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:45,200
Okay?

376
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:50,320
So we'll need, uh,
uh, photos, clothing, gifts,

377
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:55,360
books she may have bought you,
CDs you may have bought together,

378
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:58,080
journal entries.

379
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:59,920
We want to empty your home...

380
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:04,320
We want to empty your life
of Clementine.

381
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:08,880
And after the mapping is done,
our technicians will do the erasing
in your home tonight.

382
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:12,280
That way, when you awake
in the morning,

383
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:16,800
you'll fixind yourself in your own bed
as if nothing had happened...

384
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:19,360
a new life awaiting you.

385
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:25,840
Wake up, buddy!

386
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:32,800
No, I'm sorry, Mrs. Sobel.

387
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:36,040
You can't have the procedure done
three times in one month.

388
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:40,720
Well, it's just not our policy...
How are you today, Mr. Barish?

389
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:44,440
Hello. I'm right here.

390
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:48,720
I know it's an emergency,
and we'll do everything we can...
We can fit you in on the first of March.

391
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:52,240
Maybe you could talk to the doctor,
a- and he...

392
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:56,560
All right, so let's make an appointment.
What day would you like
to come in this week?

393
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:00,080
Mr. Barish.
Um, he's really busy
this afternoon.

394
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:04,120
Maybe tomorrow would be better.
Around 12:15? Can you do that?

395
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:08,040
February is very busy for us
because of Valentine's Day.

396
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,240
This is, uh, Stan Fink,

397
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:19,920
one of our most experienced
and skilled technicians.

398
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,480
He'll be handling
your case tonight.

399
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:27,000
Great to meet you,
Mr. Barish.

400
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:29,000
My name is Joel Barish,

401
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:33,640
and I'm here to erase
Clementine Kruczynski.

402
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:38,720
Very good.
Now, tell me about, uh, Clementine.

403
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:41,360
Uh, I was...

404
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:45,200
living with this woman, Naomi,

405
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:47,840
uh, a couple years ago,

406
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:53,160
and my friends Rob and Carrie
invited us to this party at the beach...
I don't like parties.

407
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:56,480
Naomi couldn't go, but I went...

408
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:59,680
and I, uh, met Clementine.

409
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:02,760
I'm sorry.

410
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:05,760
Let's start with
your most recent memories...

411
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:09,440
and work backwards from there,
more or less.

412
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:11,440
There's an emotional core...

413
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:13,440
to each of our memories,

414
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:17,280
and when you eradicate that core
it starts its degradation process.

415
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:19,800
By the time you wake up
in the morning,

416
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:23,600
all the memories we've targeted
will have withered and disappeared,

417
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:25,680
as in a dream upon waking.

418
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:29,080
Is there any risk
of brain damage?

419
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:32,120
Well, uh, technically speaking,

420
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:34,120
the procedure is brain damage,

421
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:37,040
but it's on a par with
a night of heavy drinking.

422
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:39,040
Nothing you'll miss.

423
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:43,520
Comfortable?

424
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:47,200
What we're doing here, Mr. Barish,
is actually creating a map of your brain.

425
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:49,600
Okay, let's get started.

426
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:53,400
If we want to get
this procedure underway tonight,
we have some work to do.

427
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:57,320
I want you to react
to these objects, Mr. Barish,
if you will.

428
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,440
There's a good story
behind this one...

429
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:05,440
Uh, actually, Mr. Barish,
I'll get a much better
emotional readout...

430
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:09,400
if you refrain from any sort of
verbal description of the items.

431
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:11,400
Just try to focus on the memories.

432
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:14,040
Oh. Sorry. Okay.

433
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:20,240
Healthy activity up there again.
Healthy readouts. Very good.

434
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:23,600
- Here's another object.
- That's so...

435
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:26,240
Next item. Okay.

436
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:29,760
Potato head.

437
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:33,080
- Next item. Okay.

438
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:38,040
Just focus on the memories.
Patrick, do me a favor.

439
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:41,440
Hey, Patrick,
do me a favor, will ya?
Yeah.

440
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:45,360
Can you check the voltage regulator?
What do we got there?

441
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:47,360
Uh, voltage looks fine.
Really?

442
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:51,440
Well, I'm not wiping
as clean as I like here.
I'm...

443
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:59,520
Well, uh, technically the procedure
is brain damage.

444
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:04,040
Check the, uh...
Check the connections, please.

445
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:08,480
Oh, there you are.
I...

446
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:17,920
Why am I...
I don't understand
what I'm looking at.

447
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,800
Why am I
standing here and...

448
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:23,720
Oh, my God.
Déjà vu.

449
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:25,880
Déjà vu.
This is so...

450
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:28,880
All right, we should get started.
If we're gonna get the procedure...

451
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:31,880
Underway tonight,
we have some work to do.

452
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:34,480
I'm in my head already,
aren't I?

453
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:37,880
I suppose so.
Uh, this is about right.

454
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:40,960
This is what it...
This is what it would look like.

455
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:45,480
Very good.

456
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:47,800
We'll dispose of these mementos
when we're done here.

457
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:51,200
That way you won't be confused later
by their unexplainable presence in your home.

458
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:53,520
Ah, there we go.

459
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:55,040
Patrick?
Yeah?

460
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:57,760
Patrick, can you check...
Patrick?

461
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:01,320
I'm getting some sort of readout
of my own voice.
Patrick? Patrick?

462
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:05,280
- Why are there so many wires?
A lot of equipment.

463
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:09,160
- Does that help?
Are you sure
you set that thing up properly?

464
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:11,160
How's that?
How are you today,
Mr. Barish?

465
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:13,320
There we are,
Mr. Barish.
That's better.

466
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:16,720
- I don't know if I like this.
- Think I might try this, then.

467
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,720
We're almost done now.

468
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:21,880
Mmm. Journal.
That would be invaluable.

469
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:26,080
"I met someone tonight.
I don't know what to do.

470
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:28,720
Her name is Clementine,
and she's amazing. "

471
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:31,320
Whoa! Jesus!

472
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:34,320
What? What?
Come on! Careful!
Step back!

473
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:36,320
Just take it easy.

474
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:38,200
That's fine.

475
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:40,120
Let's not roach the guy.

476
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:45,640
All right, you got that one.

477
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:49,520
This place is sort of a dump,
don't you think?
It's an apartment, Patrick.

478
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:51,880
Patrick.

479
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:56,040
Well, not a dump, then,
but sorta plain. Uninspired.

480
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:58,560
And there's sort of
a stale smell.

481
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:03,160
Patrick, can we just please
get through this?

482
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:06,880
We got a very long night
ahead of us. Come on.
Yeah. Yeah.

483
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:14,400
This is the last time I saw you.

484
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:31,520
It's 3:00.

485
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:36,160
I kinda sorta wrecked your car.

486
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:38,200
Were you driving drunk?

487
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:40,520
It's pathetic.

488
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:42,800
I was a little tipsy.

489
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,840
Don't call me pathetic.

490
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:46,840
Well, it is pathetic.

491
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:49,840
It's fucking irresponsible.
Could've killed somebody.
Oh, God.

492
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:52,840
Maybe you did kill somebody.
Should we turn on the news and see?
Oh, Christ!

493
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:56,200
Should I check the grill to see
if there's any children or small animals?
I didn't kill anybody!

494
00:35:56,280 --> 00:36:00,120
It's just a fucking dent, Joel.
You're like an old lady or something.

495
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:02,640
Well, what are you like?

496
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:04,640
A wino?
A wino?

497
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:07,640
Jesus, are you from the '50s
or something?

498
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:09,640
A wino?

499
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:11,960
Face it, Joely.

500
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:16,480
You're freaked out because
I was out late without you,

501
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:19,480
and in your little wormy brain...

502
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:23,560
you're trying to figure out,
did she fuck someone tonight?

503
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:27,080
No, see, Clem,

504
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:29,760
I assume
you fucked someone tonight.

505
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:32,280
Isn't that how you get people
to like you?

506
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:45,520
I'm sorry. Okay?

507
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:48,400
Clem, I didn't mean it.
All right?

508
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,840
Clem?
Your keys.

509
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:58,880
I was just... I was just...
I won't need them anymore.

510
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:02,040
Angry or annoyed or something,
I don't know.

511
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,720
Clem?

512
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:15,720
Got it.

513
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:17,720
Mary's coming over tonight.

514
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:19,400
Yeah?
Yeah.

515
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:21,400
Just thought you'd wanna know.

516
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:24,520
I like Mary. I like when she comes to visit.
I just don't think she likes me.

517
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:27,160
She likes you okay.

518
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:30,320
Maybe I should invite my girlfriend over.
I have a girlfriend now.

519
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:32,920
Do whatever you want.
Did I tell you I have...

520
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,920
Yeah.

521
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:42,320
Did I tell you
I have a new girlfriend?

522
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:44,360
We gotta focus here,
Patrick.

523
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:46,360
Yeah, the thing is,

524
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:49,320
our situation is...
is a little weird.

525
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:51,360
My girlfriend situation.

526
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:54,240
I'm sure it is.

527
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:56,320
You gotta be...

528
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,320
Clem, let me drive you home.

529
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:26,480
Get out of my face, faggot!

530
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:31,440
Look at it out here!
It's all falling apart!

531
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:33,880
I'm erasing you, and I'm happy!

532
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:35,880
You did it to me first!

533
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:39,960
I can't believe
you did this to me.
Goddamn it.

534
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:42,960
Clem! Can you hear me?

535
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:45,640
By morning you'll be gone!

536
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:49,200
The perfect ending
to this piece-of-shit story!

537
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:58,000
Is there something wrong
with a girl being attracted to me?
Is that a problem?

538
00:38:58,080 --> 00:39:00,600
No, I think it's... funny.

539
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:03,760
So, who do you think's better-looking,
me or this guy?

540
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:05,800
Patrick, let's focus, buddy.

541
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:08,440
Remember that girl
we did last week?

542
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:11,640
The one with the... potatoes?

543
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:16,800
That girl?
That's this guy's girl.

544
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:18,800
Right.
Yeah.

545
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:21,800
Was. We took care of that.

546
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:24,360
Oh, God!
Well, uh...

547
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:27,320
I kinda fell in love with her
that night.

548
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:30,320
What? You little fuck...

549
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:33,360
What?
She was unconscious, man.

550
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:36,480
Well, she was beautiful, and...

551
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:39,560
I stole a pair of her panties
as well.

552
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,400
Jesus!
What?

553
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:46,400
It's not like...

554
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:49,440
I mean, they were clean and all.
Don't tell me this stuff, man!
I don't wanna hear this shit!

555
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:51,960
They were clean!
What? D-Don't! Stop!

556
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:54,480
Okay. Yeah! All right!
We got work to do.

557
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:56,520
Give me my papers.

558
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,440
There's, um...

559
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:15,800
There's more.

560
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:19,880
After we did her, I kind of...

561
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:23,360
went to where she works
and asked her out.

562
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:26,760
You what?

563
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:29,480
Jesus.
Jesus, Patrick!

564
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:33,520
Do you have... any idea...

565
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:35,400
how unethical...

566
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:38,400
It's not really that bad.

567
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:41,200
What? Get that look off your face.
What's wrong?

568
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:44,600
Patrick, you stole a girl's panties!

569
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,880
There's someone here.

570
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:00,880
He stole your underwear.

571
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:05,120
I don't see anyone.

572
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:23,640
Joel?

573
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:26,120
Where are my boots?

574
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:29,640
Why are you showing me poisons?
Can't you understand English?

575
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:32,720
"Potions," I said.
Potions.

576
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:41,120
Love potion, please.

577
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:44,080
I'm fucking crawling
out of my skin!

578
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:49,720
Should've left you
at the flea market.

579
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:54,040
First thing to do is...

580
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:57,080
Sift in a cup
of powdered whale heart.

581
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:04,480
Wanna go?

582
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:07,800
I want to have a baby.

583
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:10,760
Let's talk about it later.

584
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:14,000
No! I want to have a baby.

585
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:18,080
I don't think we're ready.

586
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:20,160
You're not ready.

587
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:23,480
Clem, do you really think
you could take care of a kid?

588
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:25,720
What?

589
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:29,640
I don't wanna
talk about it here.

590
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:32,480
I can't hear you.
I can never the fuck understand
what you're saying.

591
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:35,000
I don't wanna talk about this!
Fucking ventriloquist!

592
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:37,480
We're fucking
gonna talk about it!
I... don't... want... to...

593
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:40,160
You can't just say something like that
and say you don't wanna talk about it!

594
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:43,160
I'm sorry, Clem.
I'd make a fucking good mother!

595
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:47,680
I love children, I'm creative and smart,
and I'd make a fucking great mother!
Oh, God... Mmm!

596
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:51,120
It's you, Joel. It's you
who can't commit to anything!

597
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:54,880
It's going! It's going!
You have no idea how lucky you are
I'm interested in you!

598
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:57,880
Maybe I should end this
right here, Joel!

599
00:42:57,960 --> 00:43:01,320
Leave you at the flea market
with this stupid costume jewelry!
It's done. This is crap.

600
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:04,880
Maybe you could find yourself
an antique rocking chair to die in!
All the pain, confusion...

601
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:15,480
Oh. Hi, Patrick.
Hi, Mary. How's it goin'?

602
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:18,520
Hey, you.
Oh, it's freezing outside.

603
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:20,400
Find us okay?
Yeah.

604
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:26,280
Mmm.
Hot!

605
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:29,400
Poor guy.

606
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:32,200
Mmm? Oh.

607
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:34,520
Don't you have
anything real to drink?

608
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:37,520
Uh, we haven't really
checked yet.

609
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:39,520
Patrick?
Uh, yeah.

610
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:42,000
Uh, let me do the honors.

611
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:45,240
Mary hates me.

612
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:47,960
Never really had much luck
with the ladies.

613
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:49,960
Maybe if you stop
stealing their panties.

614
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:53,080
Stan. Stan.

615
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:54,560
There's more.
No!

616
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:55,960
Yes.
No!

617
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:59,920
Hey, hey!

618
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,920
Oh, you didn't want any,
did you, Patrick?

619
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,600
Uh, no, that's okay.
Wait.

620
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:09,960
"Blessed are the forgetful,
for they get the better
even of their blunders."

621
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:13,960
Oh.

622
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:15,960
Oh!
Oh!

623
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:18,800
Mmm!

624
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:24,240
That's Nietzsche.
Beyond Good and Evil.

625
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:26,560
I found it in my Bartlett's.

626
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:28,560
What's your Bartlett's?

627
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:30,560
It's a quote book, Patrick.

628
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:32,520
It's a book of quotations.

629
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:35,080
I think Howard
will be in Bartlett's
one day.

630
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:37,080
Definitely.
Howard is pure Bartlett's.

631
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:39,520
God!

632
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:42,160
Can you wake him up?

633
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:44,160
You can't wake him up.

634
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:49,400
Mmm.

635
00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:55,720
You don't tell me things, Joel.

636
00:44:57,280 --> 00:44:59,200
I'm an open book.

637
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:02,360
I tell you everything.

638
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:05,680
Every damn embarrassing thing.

639
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:10,360
You don't trust me.

640
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:14,000
Constantly talking
isn't necessarily communicating.

641
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:18,400
I don't do that.

642
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:22,880
I want to know you.

643
00:45:24,080 --> 00:45:26,000
Hmm?

644
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:29,080
I don't constantly talk.
Jesus!

645
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:33,120
People have to
share things, Joel.

646
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:35,160
Mm-hmm.

647
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:37,320
That's what intimacy is.

648
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:40,320
I'm really pissed
that you said that to me.

649
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:42,320
I'm sorry.

650
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:45,360
It just... really just
isn't that interesting.

651
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:49,520
I wanna read some of those journals
you're constantly scribbling in.

652
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:52,760
What do you write in there
if you don't have any thoughts
or passions or...

653
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:54,840
Iove?

654
00:46:01,640 --> 00:46:06,720
November 19, 2003.

655
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:09,440
Dinner at Kang's again.

656
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:14,800
Are we like those poor couples...

657
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:17,600
you feel sorry for in restaurants?

658
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:20,040
Are we the dining dead?

659
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:24,800
I can't stand the idea of us being
a couple people think that about.

660
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:31,200
I like that.

661
00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:34,480
How's the chicken?

662
00:46:34,520 --> 00:46:36,520
Good.

663
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:40,920
More?
No. No. Thank you.

664
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:46,400
She's gonna be drunk
and stupid now.

665
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:48,880
Hey, would you
do me a favor...

666
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:51,920
and clean the goddamn hair off the soap
when you're done in the shower?

667
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,920
Yeah. Oh. Yeah.
It's really...

668
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,080
- Gross.
- Gross.

669
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:00,880
- It's just...
- Repulsive.

670
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:02,640
It's repulsive.

671
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:11,080
Patrick, can we get through this?

672
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:12,920
Patrick.

673
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:14,920
Hey, Tangerine.

674
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:18,120
Oh, Patrick, it's you.

675
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:20,440
I'm so miserable right now.

676
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:22,920
Why? What's wrong?
I don't know.

677
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:24,920
Excuse me?
I'm so confused!

678
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:26,920
Can I help you
fixind something, sir?

679
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:30,000
Confused? What are you confused about?
Everything's fixine.

680
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:32,920
Baby, come here.

681
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
Scared of what?

682
00:47:39,080 --> 00:47:42,080
Do you love me?
Of course I do.

683
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:44,120
Where's the self-help section?

684
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:46,640
Do you think I'm ugly?

685
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:49,160
No! You're beautiful!

686
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:51,480
Maybe I should come over.
No, no.

687
00:47:51,560 --> 00:47:54,480
I don't know.
L- I'm a mess, Patrick.

688
00:47:54,560 --> 00:47:57,240
Well, just let me come over.
I'll cheer you up.

689
00:47:57,320 --> 00:47:59,200
Okay.

690
00:47:59,240 --> 00:48:02,440
Stan, can I leave for a while?
My girlfriend's really upset.

691
00:48:02,520 --> 00:48:04,720
We're right in the middle
of erasing this poor man's...

692
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:06,720
Let him go, Stan!

693
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:09,720
Let him go. I'll help.

694
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:11,720
See?
How hard can it be?

695
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:15,480
- She hates me.
She wants me to go.
- Go.

696
00:48:15,560 --> 00:48:18,480
All right.
I'll be right over, Tangerine.

697
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:20,240
You like?

698
00:48:20,320 --> 00:48:23,360
Oh, man!

699
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:25,400
I matched my sweatshirt exactly.

700
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:27,400
I like it.
You do?

701
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:29,720
You look like a tangerine.
Ohh!

702
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:33,240
"Clemen-teen" the tangerine.
Mmm! Juicy!

703
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:35,800
And seedless.
I like that.

704
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:39,680
I like tangerines!

705
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:41,920
Can you see me doing ducks?

706
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,920
Tangerine.
Joel. Ducks.
Quack-quack.

707
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:47,920
How does he know
to call you that?
How did who know?

708
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:50,720
Oh, my God. Clem?
This is pretty cool.

709
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:52,760
That's what
they called themselves.

710
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:55,240
The Clash...
the only band that mattered.

711
00:48:55,320 --> 00:48:57,240
They called themselves that
for a reason.

712
00:48:57,320 --> 00:49:00,680
It's amazing, isn't it?
Like social justice...
Yeah, it's totally incredible.

713
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:03,280
What Howard
gives to the world.

714
00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:06,400
Yeah.

715
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:08,880
To let people begin again.

716
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:12,880
It's beautiful.

717
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:17,920
You look at a baby,
and it's so pure and so free
and so clean.

718
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:21,400
And adults are, like,
this mess of sadness...

719
00:49:21,480 --> 00:49:24,280
and... phobias.

720
00:49:24,360 --> 00:49:27,400
Howard just makes it all go away.

721
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:39,280
Oh, my God.

722
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:44,000
Baby, what's going on?
I don't know.
I don't know!

723
00:49:44,080 --> 00:49:46,480
I'm lost, I'm scared,

724
00:49:46,520 --> 00:49:48,480
I feel like I'm disappearing.

725
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:51,480
Disappearing?
My skin's coming off!
I'm getting old!

726
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:54,480
Nothing makes any sense to me!
You're not getting old.

727
00:49:54,520 --> 00:49:57,760
Nothing makes any sense.
Nothing makes any sense.
Ohh, Tangerine.

728
00:49:57,840 --> 00:50:00,120
Nothing makes any sense.

729
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:03,840
Nothing makes any sense, Patrick.
It's okay. It's okay.

730
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:07,960
Hey, let's go out dancing. Yeah?
You wanna go out to Montauk with me?

731
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,960
Montauk?
Yeah.

732
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:13,720
No! Come up to Boston with me.
Sure. Yeah.
We can go next weekend.

733
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:17,040
No, no. Now. Now.
Yeah. I have to go now.

734
00:50:17,080 --> 00:50:19,520
I have to see
the frozen Charles now.

735
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:25,520
Hi, it's Joel.

736
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:30,800
Um, leave a message after the beep
and I'll get back to you.

737
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:35,320
Pick up! Pick up, man!

738
00:50:35,360 --> 00:50:38,160
W-W-W-W-Whoa.
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

739
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:42,680
Hello? Yeah, what's up?

740
00:50:42,760 --> 00:50:45,840
I got into a little situation
with the old lady.

741
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:48,680
Can you handle things tonight alone?
I'm really sorry, man.

742
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:51,680
Don't worry about it.
I got it under control, man.

743
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:55,320
He's pretty much on autopilot
right now anyway.
Thanks, Stan. I owe you big-time.

744
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:58,120
Dude, I gotta go.
I gotta go.

745
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
Charles.

746
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:06,120
Come on, Charles.

747
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:15,080
"Look! You and me on the Charles River.
I could die right now, Clem.

748
00:51:15,160 --> 00:51:19,360
I'm just happy.
I've never felt that before.
I'm just exactly where I want..."

749
00:51:21,320 --> 00:51:24,000
I'm so excited. Yea.
I'm excited too!

750
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:27,920
Cool.
Oh, uh, I, uh...

751
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,880
I got you this...

752
00:51:30,920 --> 00:51:34,000
What?
Thing, um...

753
00:51:34,080 --> 00:51:36,000
Happy early Valentine's Day.

754
00:51:36,080 --> 00:51:38,080
Oh!

755
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:41,520
Wow. What is it?

756
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:44,120
Uh, I don't know.
Open it up.

757
00:51:49,640 --> 00:51:51,600
Oh.

758
00:51:51,640 --> 00:51:53,600
It... It's gorgeous!

759
00:51:53,640 --> 00:51:56,600
- You like it?
- Yeah. It's just my taste. Really.

760
00:51:56,680 --> 00:52:01,040
I've never gone out with a guy
who bought me a piece of jewelry I liked.

761
00:52:01,080 --> 00:52:03,080
Thank you.

762
00:52:10,120 --> 00:52:12,040
Let's go.
Okay.

763
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:15,360
Joely?
Yeah, Tangerine?

764
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,520
Am I ugly?

765
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:23,040
Mm-mmm.
When I was a kid,
I thought I was.

766
00:52:23,120 --> 00:52:27,200
Can't believe I'm crying already.

767
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:33,120
Sometimes I think people
don't understand how lonely it is
to be a kid.

768
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:36,240
Like you don't matter.

769
00:52:36,280 --> 00:52:39,640
So, I'm eight...

770
00:52:39,720 --> 00:52:41,960
and I have these toys,

771
00:52:42,040 --> 00:52:43,960
these dolls.

772
00:52:44,040 --> 00:52:48,760
My favorite is this ugly girl doll
who I call Clementine.

773
00:52:48,840 --> 00:52:50,760
And I keep yelling at her:

774
00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:55,200
"You can't be ugly! Be pretty!"

775
00:52:55,240 --> 00:52:57,280
It's weird.

776
00:52:57,360 --> 00:53:00,400
Like if I can transform her,

777
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:03,080
I would magically change too.

778
00:53:07,840 --> 00:53:09,760
You're pretty.

779
00:53:09,840 --> 00:53:13,000
Joely, don't ever leave me.

780
00:53:13,080 --> 00:53:17,080
Pretty. Pretty.
Pretty. Pretty.

781
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:21,120
Mierzwiak, please
let me keep this memory.

782
00:53:21,160 --> 00:53:23,120
Just this one.

783
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:26,120
I don't wanna hold your hand.
Come on.

784
00:53:26,200 --> 00:53:27,880
Whoo!
Whoa!

785
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:29,880
Stop it!

786
00:53:33,320 --> 00:53:36,000
I could die right now, Clem.

787
00:53:37,240 --> 00:53:39,200
I'm just...

788
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:43,200
happy.

789
00:53:45,120 --> 00:53:47,760
I've never felt that before.

790
00:53:48,920 --> 00:53:50,840
Mmm.

791
00:53:50,920 --> 00:53:52,880
I'm just exactly...

792
00:53:55,160 --> 00:53:57,120
where I wanna be.

793
00:53:58,200 --> 00:54:00,200
Clem?

794
00:54:06,440 --> 00:54:08,920
I wanna call it off.

795
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
I'll give you a sign.

796
00:54:15,320 --> 00:54:17,320
I wanna call it off!

797
00:54:19,720 --> 00:54:22,680
Can you hear me?
I don't want this anymore!

798
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:25,120
I wanna call it off!

799
00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:29,000
When you ain't got nothing to do

800
00:54:29,080 --> 00:54:31,080
I think I'll marry you

801
00:54:31,160 --> 00:54:34,920
Is anybody there?

802
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:43,800
Clementine?
Joel?

803
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:46,120
Clement...
Joely?

804
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:48,280
Clem!
Joel?

805
00:54:48,360 --> 00:54:51,160
Clem!

806
00:54:51,240 --> 00:54:53,480
What?
We gotta go.
We gotta go.

807
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:55,960
What? Where?
I have an idea
of how to stop this.

808
00:54:56,040 --> 00:54:58,360
Stop what?

809
00:54:58,440 --> 00:55:00,360
Joely.
Come on, Clem.

810
00:55:00,440 --> 00:55:03,760
Smell my armpit!
Smell my armpit!
No!

811
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:06,360
Don't tickle me!
Don't make me smell you.
Smell my pits!

812
00:55:06,440 --> 00:55:08,400
No.
Good.

813
00:55:08,440 --> 00:55:10,800
Concentrate, Clem.

814
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:13,360
We gotta get back
to the office.

815
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:16,000
There was a tape recorder.
No, not the picture.

816
00:55:16,040 --> 00:55:18,080
Not the picture.

817
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:21,240
Where is it? Back here.
Come on!

818
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:23,960
Oh, look at me.
Hey, I look good there.

819
00:55:24,040 --> 00:55:27,720
Look, our fixiles are confidential,
Mr. Barish,

820
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:29,720
so I can't show you evidence.

821
00:55:29,800 --> 00:55:33,200
Suffice it to say that Miss, uh...
Miss Kruczynski...

822
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:37,160
was not happy
and she wanted to move on.

823
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:41,760
Good. Now, tell me about Clementine.
Just tell me everything you remember.

824
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:44,680
That's what he said. Then...
What did we see that day?

825
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:46,680
No, wait.
Oh, look! Hey!

826
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:49,240
Shit!
We're going to see
my grandma.

827
00:55:49,320 --> 00:55:52,040
Joel, why... No, I don't want to...
Joel, please!
We're not going on a train.

828
00:55:52,080 --> 00:55:54,840
Don't make me run anymore.
Come on!

829
00:55:54,920 --> 00:55:57,280
Mierzwiak!

830
00:55:57,320 --> 00:56:00,320
Do we always have to run?
Mierzwiak!

831
00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:11,600
Please.

832
00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:15,040
So, why don't we begin
by you telling me...

833
00:56:15,120 --> 00:56:17,200
everything you can remember.

834
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:19,760
Mierzwiak! Wake me up!

835
00:56:19,840 --> 00:56:22,880
Oh, l-I'm sorry, Mr. Barish.

836
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:25,960
I thought you understood
what was going on here.

837
00:56:26,040 --> 00:56:29,200
I don't know.
You're erasing her from me.

838
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:32,200
You're erasing me from her...

839
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:36,680
I don't know.

840
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:40,400
You've got this thing.
I'm in my bed. I know it.

841
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:42,400
I'm in my brain.

842
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:45,400
I'm part of your imagination too, Joel.

843
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:48,080
How can I help you
from there?

844
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:51,640
Uh, I'm inside your head too.
I'm you.

845
00:56:51,720 --> 00:56:55,360
Sorry.

846
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:57,480
Look. Who's that?

847
00:56:57,560 --> 00:56:59,600
Oh, he-he works for us.

848
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:04,360
That's, uh, Pa-a-a-a-atrick,

849
00:57:04,440 --> 00:57:07,040
baby boy.

850
00:57:07,120 --> 00:57:09,600
He's stealing my identity.

851
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:12,080
He stole my stuff.

852
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:15,840
He's, uh, seducing my girlfriend
with my words and my things.

853
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:19,120
He stole her underwear.
Oh, Jesus Christ!

854
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:21,120
He stole her underwear.

855
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:24,600
I could die right now, Clem.

856
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:27,120
I'm just happy.

857
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:31,800
I've never felt that before.
I'm just exactly where
I want to be.

858
00:57:33,320 --> 00:57:35,320
I want to go home.

859
00:57:36,440 --> 00:57:38,360
Hey. What?

860
00:57:40,800 --> 00:57:44,440
Clem!

861
00:57:44,520 --> 00:57:46,480
Wait. Clem!

862
00:57:47,560 --> 00:57:49,760
Clem?

863
00:57:49,840 --> 00:57:52,320
They're erasing you.

864
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:54,320
I'm here1

865
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:57,040
Clem, focus.
I hired them, okay?

866
00:57:57,120 --> 00:57:59,040
I'm so stupid.

867
00:57:59,120 --> 00:58:02,160
Sweetie, calm down.
Enjoy the scenery.

868
00:58:02,240 --> 00:58:05,560
I need it to stop before I wake up
and I don't know you anymore.

869
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:11,440
Okay, well, you know,
just tell them to cancel it then.

870
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:14,720
What the hell are you talking about?
I can't just cancel it. I'm asleep.

871
00:58:14,800 --> 00:58:16,560
Wake yourself up!

872
00:58:16,640 --> 00:58:19,400
Okay. You want me to wake up?
Okay. Great. All right.

873
00:58:19,480 --> 00:58:22,360
Okay, here we go.
This make you happy if I try?
Yeah.

874
00:58:22,440 --> 00:58:25,480
I'll try really hard. Here we go.
That was a great idea.

875
00:58:25,560 --> 00:58:27,680
Yeah. Okay.

876
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:31,000
Boy, that's working
like gangbusters.

877
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:33,560
Don't! That tickles me!
Oh, my goodness.

878
00:58:33,640 --> 00:58:36,080
Oh, my God. What is that?
Jesus Christ! What the...

879
00:58:36,160 --> 00:58:38,080
It's a birthmark!

880
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:44,680
It did work, for a second,

881
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:47,240
but I couldn't...
I couldn't move.
See?

882
00:58:47,320 --> 00:58:52,000
Oh, well, isn't that just another one
ofJoel's self-fulfilling prophecies?

883
00:58:52,080 --> 00:58:54,400
It's more important
to prove me wrong
than to actually...

884
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:57,640
Look, I don't want to
discuss this right now, okay?

885
00:58:57,720 --> 00:59:01,040
Fine.

886
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:04,120
Then what? I'm listening.

887
00:59:04,200 --> 00:59:06,880
I don't know.
You erased me.

888
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:09,600
That's why I'm here.
That's why I'm doing this
in the first place.

889
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:11,640
I'm sorry.
You... You!

890
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:14,120
You know me. I'm impulsive.

891
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:19,520
That's what I love
about you.

892
00:59:23,320 --> 00:59:24,840
Joel?

893
00:59:24,920 --> 00:59:27,880
Mm-hmm?
I have another idea
for this problem.

894
00:59:27,960 --> 00:59:30,200
This is a memory of me,

895
00:59:30,280 --> 00:59:34,960
the way you wanted
to have sex on the couch after you
looked down at my crotch.

896
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:38,000
What?
Joel, the eraser guys
are coming here,

897
00:59:38,040 --> 00:59:41,040
so what if you take me
somewhere else,

898
00:59:41,120 --> 00:59:43,280
somewhere
where I don't belong,

899
00:59:43,360 --> 00:59:45,920
and we hide there
till morning?

900
00:59:50,320 --> 00:59:53,720
Oh, man. I can't remember
anything without you.

901
00:59:53,800 --> 00:59:56,960
Tsk, that's very sweet,
but try, okay?

902
00:59:57,040 --> 00:59:58,960
Okay.

903
00:59:59,040 --> 01:00:04,360
Row, row, row your boat
gently down the stream

904
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:06,640
Merrily, merrily
merrily, merrily

905
01:00:06,720 --> 01:00:10,360
Row, row, row your boat
gently down the stream

906
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:13,360
Row, row, row your boat
Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily

907
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:17,080
Life is but a dream
Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily

908
01:00:17,160 --> 01:00:19,960
Merrily, merrily
merrily, merrily

909
01:00:20,040 --> 01:00:23,280
Life is but a dream
Row, row, row your boat

910
01:00:23,320 --> 01:00:25,400
It's working!
Row, row, row your boat

911
01:00:25,480 --> 01:00:29,040
Gently down the stream
I'm a genius!

912
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:51,440
Joel?

913
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:53,720
Joel?

914
01:00:55,480 --> 01:00:57,640
Where'd you go?

915
01:00:57,720 --> 01:00:59,480
I'm supposed to come too!

916
01:00:59,560 --> 01:01:03,080
Listen, I'm just gonna
go get a salad bowl. Can you stir the soup
and keep an eye on Joel?

917
01:01:03,160 --> 01:01:05,120
Sure.
He just likes to be near me.

918
01:01:05,160 --> 01:01:07,160
Absolutely!
Clem?

919
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:11,360
It worked.
My God, look at this! Wow!

920
01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:15,600
It worked! Look!
Look at this dress, man!

921
01:01:15,680 --> 01:01:20,240
Oh, my God! Look at it!
I wish I could take it with me.

922
01:01:20,320 --> 01:01:22,720
Who am I?

923
01:01:22,800 --> 01:01:24,680
Mrs. Hamlyn.
Right. Mrs. Hamlyn.

924
01:01:24,760 --> 01:01:27,320
I must be about four.
Oh, my gosh.

925
01:01:27,400 --> 01:01:30,680
Found the salad bowl,
so I'm serving salad and string beans.

926
01:01:30,760 --> 01:01:33,240
Is he okay under there?
Peanut, are you all right?

927
01:01:33,320 --> 01:01:37,040
God, honestly, I feel like
I could clean up all day.

928
01:01:37,120 --> 01:01:40,160
Listen, would you hate me if I asked you
to clean some string beans?
No, not at all.

929
01:01:40,240 --> 01:01:42,760
Oh, my God.
I love this kitchen.

930
01:01:42,840 --> 01:01:45,840
Thank you so much.
She's not looking at me.

931
01:01:45,920 --> 01:01:49,040
She's busy.
She's not looking at me.

932
01:01:49,120 --> 01:01:52,440
No one ever looks at me.
I want my mommy.

933
01:01:52,520 --> 01:01:55,520
Oh, babyJoel.
Hey, Joely! Joely!

934
01:01:55,600 --> 01:01:58,120
Is every little peanut
under there okay?
Mm-hmm! He's fine.

935
01:01:58,200 --> 01:02:00,520
Do you have something to drink?

936
01:02:00,600 --> 01:02:03,240
Would you drink
a cocktail at this hour?
I mean, I know it's not 5:00.

937
01:02:03,320 --> 01:02:05,840
I would die for a vodka.
Oh, hang on.
Let me check if I have that.

938
01:02:05,920 --> 01:02:08,640
Okay! I'm just
gonna wait right here.
Joel! Hey, no, sweetie.

939
01:02:08,720 --> 01:02:10,640
Uh, Joely.

940
01:02:10,720 --> 01:02:14,320
Your mother wants me to mind you.
Get back under the table.
Ice cream.

941
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:18,760
Ice cream.
No, not until after, you know,
you've had your dinner.

942
01:02:18,840 --> 01:02:20,880
Come on, Joel!

943
01:02:20,960 --> 01:02:22,880
Joel, grow up!

944
01:02:22,960 --> 01:02:25,320
Don't leave me, Clem.
Oh, my God, Clem.

945
01:02:25,400 --> 01:02:27,840
This is sort of warped.
I'm scared

946
01:02:27,880 --> 01:02:31,200
I want my mommy!
Don't cry, babyJoel.

947
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:35,560
BabyJoel, it's okay.
Joel. Joely. Joel!

948
01:02:35,640 --> 01:02:38,440
Stop it! Look, I think it's working.
Look, we're hidden, Joel. Look!

949
01:02:38,520 --> 01:02:41,320
Hey, honey, look.

950
01:02:41,400 --> 01:02:43,400
Wait there.

951
01:02:46,760 --> 01:02:49,520
My crotch is still here,
just as you remembered it.

952
01:02:49,560 --> 01:02:51,520
Yuck.

953
01:02:54,200 --> 01:02:57,680
It stopped.

954
01:02:57,760 --> 01:03:01,480
What?
It stopped erasing.

955
01:03:01,560 --> 01:03:04,000
Oh, shit.

956
01:03:04,080 --> 01:03:06,040
This is terrible.

957
01:03:07,600 --> 01:03:09,880
He's off the map.
He's off the map.

958
01:03:09,960 --> 01:03:13,520
Where?
I don't know where!
What do you mean? I don't know where!

959
01:03:13,600 --> 01:03:17,680
This is bad.
This is very, very bad news.
Where are my glasses?

960
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:20,320
Okay. Crap.

961
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:23,160
Okay. What do we do?
What do I do?

962
01:03:23,240 --> 01:03:25,800
What shall we do?
I don't know what to do.
I don't know what to do.

963
01:03:25,880 --> 01:03:28,120
- What shall we do?
- Crap. Crap. I don't know!

964
01:03:28,200 --> 01:03:30,800
- I just said that I don't know what to do.
- I'm sorry. What do we do?

965
01:03:30,880 --> 01:03:34,480
I don't know.
Now, look, you're freaking me out.
Mellow out.

966
01:03:34,560 --> 01:03:38,400
Well, you have to do something.
He could wake up all half-baked.

967
01:03:38,480 --> 01:03:41,480
Quiet. You're freaking me out.
Shh. Shh.

968
01:03:41,560 --> 01:03:44,560
All gooey and... and half-baked.
Hmm, that sounds so good.

969
01:03:44,640 --> 01:03:46,560
Oh, shit!
I'm hungry.

970
01:03:46,640 --> 01:03:48,560
Oh, shit.
Oh! Oh!

971
01:03:48,640 --> 01:03:51,120
What? Oh! What, what?
What?

972
01:03:51,160 --> 01:03:54,120
- We should call Howard.
- No way. No, sir, man.

973
01:03:54,160 --> 01:03:56,320
This is my...
I can handle this.

974
01:03:56,400 --> 01:03:58,720
I can't call Howard.
He's an unbaked cookie.

975
01:03:58,800 --> 01:04:01,480
He's... There's no time
to fuck around.

976
01:04:01,560 --> 01:04:04,040
I got this under control.
What are you talking about?

977
01:04:04,120 --> 01:04:07,000
Stop fucking around!
Okay, I'll call Howard.

978
01:04:14,720 --> 01:04:18,080
Hello.
Hello, Howard?
Hey, it's Stan.

979
01:04:18,160 --> 01:04:22,000
Um, I'm working on this guy
down here, and we seem to have
lost him for a moment,

980
01:04:22,080 --> 01:04:24,840
and, uh, I can't...
I can't bring him back up.

981
01:04:24,920 --> 01:04:28,360
Okay, uh, tell me what happened
before he disappeared.

982
01:04:28,400 --> 01:04:31,800
Well, I wasn't sure, really,
'cause I was away from the monitor
for a minute...

983
01:04:31,880 --> 01:04:34,560
and I had it on autopilot
because I had to, uh...

984
01:04:34,640 --> 01:04:36,600
I had to pee.

985
01:04:36,640 --> 01:04:40,360
Where's Patrick?
Patrick? Patrick had to
go home sick.

986
01:04:40,440 --> 01:04:42,360
Ah, geez.

987
01:04:42,440 --> 01:04:45,200
Okay, what's the address?
I know. I'm so sorry.

988
01:04:45,280 --> 01:04:48,960
That's okay. Come on.
I'm at 159 South Village.

989
01:04:49,040 --> 01:04:52,200
Yeah.
Apartment 1 E.
Rockville Center.

990
01:04:52,280 --> 01:04:54,920
Mary?
He's coming right now.
Yeah?

991
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:56,920
I'm staying.

992
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,360
- Get your stuff, Mary.
- I'm staying.

993
01:04:59,440 --> 01:05:01,920
I think you should go.
Hell, no.

994
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:05,600
Mary... Shit.

995
01:05:05,680 --> 01:05:09,680
I am so stoned.
Please, Mary.

996
01:05:09,760 --> 01:05:12,120
You have to go.
Stop being stoned, Mary.

997
01:05:12,200 --> 01:05:15,000
I don't want him
to see me stoned.

998
01:05:15,040 --> 01:05:19,240
Mary, you have no idea how much trouble
we're gonna get into if Howard comes...
I look like shit!

999
01:05:19,280 --> 01:05:22,480
Joely, stop it! Joel!
Look! Hey, Joel!

1000
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:30,400
Joel!
I want her to pick me up.

1001
01:05:30,480 --> 01:05:34,000
It's weird how strong
that desire is.
Joel, look at me! Look.

1002
01:05:34,080 --> 01:05:36,400
You'll remember me
in the morning,

1003
01:05:36,480 --> 01:05:39,640
and you'll come to me,
and you'll tell me about us,
and we'll start over.

1004
01:05:39,720 --> 01:05:42,080
Pat? I just... Pat?

1005
01:05:42,160 --> 01:05:44,320
I thought we could have
a little cocktail.

1006
01:05:44,400 --> 01:05:46,840
That Patrick guy...
he's copying me.

1007
01:05:46,920 --> 01:05:48,920
What Patrick guy?

1008
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:50,760
That guy!
What?

1009
01:05:50,840 --> 01:05:52,680
He's here in my apartment.

1010
01:05:52,760 --> 01:05:54,680
He's one of those eraser guys.

1011
01:05:54,760 --> 01:05:59,080
He fell for you when they were doing you,
and now he's introduced himself
like he doesn't even know you,

1012
01:05:59,160 --> 01:06:01,520
and you guys are dating.

1013
01:06:01,560 --> 01:06:04,800
Really? Is he cute?

1014
01:06:07,200 --> 01:06:09,600
Clem,
there's nothing wrong with you.

1015
01:06:09,680 --> 01:06:12,280
You're the most wonderful
person I've ever met.

1016
01:06:12,360 --> 01:06:15,280
You... You're kind,

1017
01:06:15,360 --> 01:06:17,600
Beautiful...

1018
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:19,880
and smart and funny...

1019
01:06:19,960 --> 01:06:22,200
and... nice.

1020
01:06:22,240 --> 01:06:24,480
What?

1021
01:06:25,720 --> 01:06:28,160
Okay. All right.

1022
01:06:29,680 --> 01:06:32,000
Okay. Oh!

1023
01:06:32,080 --> 01:06:34,360
Move, move, move!
Come on. Let's go.
Careful, careful.

1024
01:06:34,440 --> 01:06:36,240
Fine.

1025
01:06:36,320 --> 01:06:39,720
Oh, my God. I'm still stoned.

1026
01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:42,160
Those eyedrops you gave me
didn't do shit.

1027
01:06:46,920 --> 01:06:48,840
Be cool. Cool.

1028
01:06:53,440 --> 01:06:55,720
Hello, Mary.
What are you doing here?
Oh, hi, Howard.

1029
01:06:55,800 --> 01:06:57,720
She was just here to help out.

1030
01:06:57,800 --> 01:07:00,960
I wanted to understand as much
as I could about the procedure
as possible.

1031
01:07:01,040 --> 01:07:04,720
I think it's important for my job
to understand the inner workings...

1032
01:07:04,800 --> 01:07:07,000
of the work that we do.

1033
01:07:07,080 --> 01:07:09,760
Well, not that I do,
but the work that is done...

1034
01:07:09,840 --> 01:07:13,520
by people... where I also work,
the work of my colleagues.

1035
01:07:13,600 --> 01:07:16,640
All right, well,
let's see if we can, uh,

1036
01:07:16,720 --> 01:07:19,280
get to the bottom of this,
shall we?

1037
01:07:19,360 --> 01:07:21,320
Uh, yeah. Um...

1038
01:07:24,080 --> 01:07:26,560
Well, that's odd.
I already tried that.

1039
01:07:26,640 --> 01:07:30,400
Did you try going
through the C-gate?
Yeah, of course.

1040
01:07:30,440 --> 01:07:32,240
I mean... yes.

1041
01:07:32,320 --> 01:07:34,560
Yeah.

1042
01:07:36,760 --> 01:07:38,720
All right.

1043
01:07:40,240 --> 01:07:42,160
You want to get linked up?
Yeah.

1044
01:07:42,240 --> 01:07:44,520
All right.

1045
01:07:44,600 --> 01:07:47,240
I already... I ran
the utility programs,

1046
01:07:47,320 --> 01:07:49,320
and I had nothing there,

1047
01:07:49,360 --> 01:07:52,360
so I checked all the memories
against the printed logs.

1048
01:07:52,440 --> 01:07:54,440
Here, Howard.
Okay.

1049
01:07:54,520 --> 01:07:56,920
I got you a chair.
There you go.
Oh, thank you.

1050
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:59,560
You're welcome.
Whew!

1051
01:07:59,640 --> 01:08:03,200
All right, I'm gonna...
I'm gonna go through
the entire memory,

1052
01:08:03,280 --> 01:08:05,280
see if something comes up.

1053
01:08:05,360 --> 01:08:08,720
Oh, my darling
Oh, my darling

1054
01:08:08,800 --> 01:08:11,960
Oh, my darling Clementine

1055
01:08:12,040 --> 01:08:14,520
You were lost
and gone forever
I love being bathed in the sink.

1056
01:08:14,600 --> 01:08:17,080
Dreadful sorry, Clementine
Such a feeling of security.

1057
01:08:17,160 --> 01:08:20,400
I've never seen you happier,
babyJoel.
Hmm!

1058
01:08:20,480 --> 01:08:22,400
There it is.

1059
01:08:22,480 --> 01:08:26,800
I don't understand
why it's off the map like that.

1060
01:08:26,880 --> 01:08:28,960
What the heck
was he doing there?

1061
01:08:38,520 --> 01:08:40,520
His eyes are open.

1062
01:08:42,400 --> 01:08:46,000
- Has this happened before with him?
- No.

1063
01:08:46,080 --> 01:08:49,640
Oh, this is...
this is not good. No.

1064
01:08:49,720 --> 01:08:51,920
I'm gonna have to...

1065
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:53,960
I'm gonna have to give him this.

1066
01:09:18,360 --> 01:09:21,000
Can't you see I love you,
Antoine?

1067
01:09:21,080 --> 01:09:24,240
Okay, we're back in.

1068
01:09:24,320 --> 01:09:28,520
Wow. That was beautiful
to watch, Howard.

1069
01:09:28,600 --> 01:09:32,640
Like a surgeon
or a concert pianist
or something.

1070
01:09:32,720 --> 01:09:34,640
Thank you, Mary.

1071
01:09:34,720 --> 01:09:38,800
Um, Howard,
you should get some sleep.
L-I think I'll be fine now.

1072
01:09:38,880 --> 01:09:43,440
Why can't you see I love you,
Antoine?

1073
01:09:43,520 --> 01:09:45,520
Hmm. Lucky me.

1074
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:50,000
Lay one on me.

1075
01:09:51,120 --> 01:09:53,280
Don't call me Antoine.

1076
01:09:53,320 --> 01:09:55,720
My name is Wally.
Yes, I know,

1077
01:09:55,800 --> 01:09:58,360
but how can a woman love a man
with a name like Wally?

1078
01:09:58,440 --> 01:10:00,840
Oh! Oh! What was that?

1079
01:10:00,920 --> 01:10:03,600
Hey.
My God, there's people
coming out of your butt.

1080
01:10:03,680 --> 01:10:06,160
There is?

1081
01:10:07,320 --> 01:10:09,800
- Got it.
- Tangerine!

1082
01:10:09,840 --> 01:10:12,880
What, Joel... What are you doing?
We gotta go.

1083
01:10:12,960 --> 01:10:15,600
Go on. Please, please, go.
Please go!

1084
01:10:18,480 --> 01:10:20,360
You can run,
but you can't hide.

1085
01:10:20,440 --> 01:10:22,240
Clem, come on!

1086
01:10:23,280 --> 01:10:25,200
There I am.

1087
01:10:25,280 --> 01:10:27,200
That truck.

1088
01:10:27,280 --> 01:10:30,160
Doc? Please.

1089
01:10:30,240 --> 01:10:34,360
All right, let's begin
by you telling me...

1090
01:10:34,440 --> 01:10:37,200
everything you remember...

1091
01:10:37,280 --> 01:10:41,200
That's strange.
He's in a memory
that we've already erased.

1092
01:10:41,240 --> 01:10:45,320
Oh, well, at least
we know where he is.
He's back on track, right?

1093
01:10:45,400 --> 01:10:47,320
Come on, Clem.

1094
01:10:47,400 --> 01:10:50,400
He seems to have developed some sort
of resistance to the procedure.

1095
01:10:50,480 --> 01:10:53,080
I don't want to run anymore.
Shit.

1096
01:10:55,120 --> 01:10:58,680
Come on, come on.
Hide me somewhere deeper,
somewhere really buried.

1097
01:10:58,760 --> 01:11:01,480
Where?
Hide me in your humiliation.

1098
01:11:02,680 --> 01:11:05,280
Humiliation.
Come on, you big baby!

1099
01:11:05,360 --> 01:11:07,280
I'm sorry, okay?

1100
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:13,640
Let me drive you home.

1101
01:11:13,720 --> 01:11:16,160
No!

1102
01:11:16,200 --> 01:11:19,680
- Bye, Howard.
- No, wait. Howard.

1103
01:11:19,760 --> 01:11:22,000
He's disappeared again.

1104
01:11:22,080 --> 01:11:26,280
Oh, dear.
I'm so sorry, Howard.

1105
01:11:26,360 --> 01:11:28,360
Humiliation.

1106
01:11:28,440 --> 01:11:31,040
Humiliation.

1107
01:11:31,120 --> 01:11:34,120
Hu-mi-lia...
Joel.

1108
01:11:34,200 --> 01:11:36,360
I don't like it either.

1109
01:11:36,440 --> 01:11:38,960
I'm just trying to find
horrible secret places to...

1110
01:11:39,040 --> 01:11:42,000
Joel, honey, I have a surprise...
I just... Oh, um...

1111
01:11:42,080 --> 01:11:44,920
Uh, you know what, honey?
I'm just gonna ask you in the morning.

1112
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,800
Good night, sweetheart.

1113
01:11:47,880 --> 01:11:50,200
No.

1114
01:11:50,280 --> 01:11:53,280
I'm sorry, Joel. Joely.
Shut up.

1115
01:11:54,520 --> 01:11:57,400
Look! Joel!

1116
01:11:57,440 --> 01:11:59,400
Joel, look!
What?

1117
01:11:59,480 --> 01:12:01,400
Look where we are!

1118
01:12:01,480 --> 01:12:03,880
Whoo!

1119
01:12:03,960 --> 01:12:06,400
Clem, this isn't good.

1120
01:12:06,480 --> 01:12:10,320
Then hide me somewhere...
somewhere really buried.

1121
01:12:13,120 --> 01:12:15,840
Hit it! Hit it!
I can't! I gotta go home.

1122
01:12:15,920 --> 01:12:18,320
I'll do it later!

1123
01:12:21,480 --> 01:12:24,960
Come on, you big sissy!

1124
01:12:33,280 --> 01:12:35,520
Ooh!

1125
01:12:35,600 --> 01:12:38,680
Ooh, he has a girlfriend!

1126
01:12:38,760 --> 01:12:41,440
Wait. What am I doing?
You know something, Freddy?
And he loves her!

1127
01:12:41,520 --> 01:12:43,680
You don't scare me anymore.
Ow! Ow!

1128
01:12:43,760 --> 01:12:45,760
Joel!

1129
01:12:45,840 --> 01:12:48,680
Joely, get up.
Come on, it's not worth it.
Hit him! Hit him!

1130
01:12:48,760 --> 01:12:53,320
They're not worth it, Joel!
Tra-la-la-la-la! He's not listening!

1131
01:12:53,400 --> 01:12:55,440
Come on, Joel.
Stupid!

1132
01:13:01,600 --> 01:13:05,440
I'm so ashamed.
It's okay.

1133
01:13:05,480 --> 01:13:07,760
You were a little kid.
Yeah?

1134
01:13:07,840 --> 01:13:10,440
Come on.
That's where I live... lived.

1135
01:13:10,520 --> 01:13:12,800
I wish I knew you
when I was a kid.

1136
01:13:12,880 --> 01:13:16,560
Do you like my pink hat?
Here, look, feel better.
You can really kill me this time.

1137
01:13:16,640 --> 01:13:19,280
It's my turn.
Go. One, two, three.
I can? You're really gonna die though.

1138
01:13:19,360 --> 01:13:21,560
Okay.
One, two, three.

1139
01:13:21,640 --> 01:13:24,120
You're dead.

1140
01:13:24,200 --> 01:13:27,480
Oh, my mom.
It's... It's okay. We're playing.

1141
01:13:27,560 --> 01:13:30,240
Hi, Joel's mom.
He's killing me.
It's not real.

1142
01:13:30,320 --> 01:13:32,560
Okay, are you dead yet?

1143
01:13:32,640 --> 01:13:34,760
You're dead!

1144
01:13:34,840 --> 01:13:36,760
Uh, I think I got the hang of this.

1145
01:13:36,840 --> 01:13:40,040
I still don't understand it,
but I'm finding him quickly enough.

1146
01:13:54,120 --> 01:13:57,440
Clem!

1147
01:13:58,440 --> 01:14:00,760
Clem!

1148
01:14:15,720 --> 01:14:17,680
Jo... Joely?

1149
01:14:17,720 --> 01:14:19,880
Are you okay, Joel?

1150
01:14:19,920 --> 01:14:22,200
Joel? Joel?

1151
01:14:22,280 --> 01:14:25,120
Oh, my God.
That was terrible.

1152
01:14:25,200 --> 01:14:27,160
Okay, okay.
That was like three seconds.

1153
01:14:27,200 --> 01:14:31,120
All right.
Let me do it one more time.
One more, then I get to go.

1154
01:14:31,200 --> 01:14:34,120
Okay.

1155
01:14:41,840 --> 01:14:44,000
Whoo-hoo-hoo!
Whoo!

1156
01:14:44,080 --> 01:14:46,440
Look at this.
This is so cool!

1157
01:14:46,480 --> 01:14:48,640
Cool. Look out! Look out!

1158
01:14:49,760 --> 01:14:51,680
Ah!

1159
01:14:51,760 --> 01:14:53,760
Shit!
It's fluff.

1160
01:14:55,320 --> 01:14:57,320
Our house!

1161
01:14:58,640 --> 01:15:00,840
Come on. Whoo-hoo!
Come on.

1162
01:15:00,920 --> 01:15:02,840
Come on.
We gotta go!

1163
01:15:02,920 --> 01:15:05,520
Whoo!

1164
01:15:05,600 --> 01:15:07,560
Come on!

1165
01:15:08,640 --> 01:15:10,560
We gotta go. Clem?

1166
01:15:10,600 --> 01:15:13,520
We gotta go.

1167
01:15:13,600 --> 01:15:15,480
Aah! Come on!

1168
01:15:15,560 --> 01:15:17,760
No!
This is a really bad time
for this!

1169
01:15:17,840 --> 01:15:20,760
Get off me! Oh, God!

1170
01:15:20,840 --> 01:15:23,760
I don't even know
where we're going.
It's gonna be fun. Come on.

1171
01:15:23,840 --> 01:15:26,360
It's the best place.
No, this way.
No, this way.

1172
01:15:26,440 --> 01:15:31,080
No, no, no. This way.
You're no help at all.

1173
01:15:31,120 --> 01:15:33,880
What's wrong with you?

1174
01:15:33,960 --> 01:15:37,120
Let go of me, Joel!

1175
01:15:49,120 --> 01:15:50,760
I like watching you work,
Howard.

1176
01:15:54,880 --> 01:15:57,360
I guess, uh...

1177
01:15:57,440 --> 01:16:00,240
I guess I'll go out
for... for some air,

1178
01:16:00,320 --> 01:16:02,280
if nobody minds.

1179
01:16:02,360 --> 01:16:05,560
It looks like you have everything
under control here.

1180
01:16:05,640 --> 01:16:07,560
Yeah, that's, uh...

1181
01:16:07,640 --> 01:16:09,560
that's fixine.

1182
01:16:19,280 --> 01:16:22,280
Do you like quotes, Howard?

1183
01:16:23,360 --> 01:16:25,280
What do you mean?

1184
01:16:25,360 --> 01:16:28,040
Oh, you know,
like famous quotes?

1185
01:16:28,120 --> 01:16:30,280
I find reading them inspirational,

1186
01:16:30,360 --> 01:16:34,280
and in my reading,
I've come across some
I thought you might like too.

1187
01:16:34,320 --> 01:16:38,000
Oh, well, I...
I'd love to hear some.

1188
01:16:38,080 --> 01:16:40,520
There's one that goes,

1189
01:16:40,560 --> 01:16:44,080
"Blessed are the forgetful,
for they get the better
even of their blunders."

1190
01:16:44,160 --> 01:16:46,080
That's Nietzsche, right?
Yeah.

1191
01:16:46,160 --> 01:16:49,160
And here I thought I could tell you
something you didn't know.
Oh, no.

1192
01:16:49,200 --> 01:16:52,360
It's... It's a good quote.
I'm happy we both know it.

1193
01:16:52,440 --> 01:16:55,400
Yeah. Oh, and there's
this other one I like.

1194
01:16:55,480 --> 01:16:58,320
It's by Pope Alexander,
and it goes...

1195
01:16:58,400 --> 01:17:00,880
Alexander Pope?
Oh, yeah.

1196
01:17:00,920 --> 01:17:02,880
Yeah, shit.

1197
01:17:02,920 --> 01:17:06,760
It's just that I told myself
not to say "Pope Alexander"
and sound like a dope,

1198
01:17:06,840 --> 01:17:08,840
and then I go ahead and say it.

1199
01:17:08,920 --> 01:17:12,440
It's no big deal.
You're such a sweetheart.

1200
01:17:14,280 --> 01:17:18,200
The quote goes, "How happy is
the blameless vestal's lot?

1201
01:17:19,440 --> 01:17:22,560
"The world forgetting,
by the world forgot.

1202
01:17:22,600 --> 01:17:26,960
"Eternal sunshine
of the spotless mind.

1203
01:17:27,040 --> 01:17:30,600
Each prayer accepted
and each wish resigned. "

1204
01:17:30,640 --> 01:17:35,600
I want to be
a great big, huge elephant...

1205
01:17:35,680 --> 01:17:38,160
with a huge trunk like that.

1206
01:17:39,560 --> 01:17:42,520
Clem? Clementine?

1207
01:17:42,560 --> 01:17:45,560
I haven't heard that one.
It's lovely.

1208
01:17:45,600 --> 01:17:48,560
I just thought it would
be appropriate, maybe.

1209
01:17:53,240 --> 01:17:56,920
I really admire
the work you do, Howard.

1210
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:59,480
I don't mean to be so familiar.
Oh, it's fine. It's fine.

1211
01:17:59,560 --> 01:18:02,080
L-l-l-l-I...
I'm happy to hear...

1212
01:18:05,880 --> 01:18:08,840
I'm sorry.

1213
01:18:12,920 --> 01:18:15,240
I've loved you
for a very long time.

1214
01:18:18,520 --> 01:18:20,840
I shouldn't have said that.
Oh, Mary, no.

1215
01:18:20,920 --> 01:18:24,160
It's... You're a wonderful girl.

1216
01:18:24,200 --> 01:18:27,920
But I... You know,
I have a wife and kids.

1217
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:29,920
You know
I have a wife and kids.

1218
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:31,920
Oh, Mary.

1219
01:18:34,040 --> 01:18:36,920
Oh, Mary, we can't do this.

1220
01:18:46,920 --> 01:18:48,920
Oh, whoa.

1221
01:18:53,360 --> 01:18:56,640
Well, good morning,
Mrs. Mierzwiak.

1222
01:19:04,040 --> 01:19:06,040
What?
Oh, my God!

1223
01:19:06,120 --> 01:19:08,640
Who is it?

1224
01:19:13,080 --> 01:19:15,440
Uh...

1225
01:19:21,120 --> 01:19:24,320
Thank you, Stan.
Thanks a lot.

1226
01:19:28,080 --> 01:19:31,120
Hollis. Hollis!

1227
01:19:31,160 --> 01:19:33,600
Hollis!

1228
01:19:33,680 --> 01:19:35,840
Wait. Wait, wait, wait.
Hollis.

1229
01:19:37,160 --> 01:19:39,640
- I knew it, Howard.
- Hollis, it didn't start out
to be like this.

1230
01:19:39,720 --> 01:19:43,080
I came here to work.
Hollis, this is a one-time mistake!

1231
01:19:43,160 --> 01:19:45,640
I'm a stupid girl
with a stupid crush!
Yeah.

1232
01:19:45,680 --> 01:19:48,200
I swear I basically
forced him into it!

1233
01:19:49,400 --> 01:19:52,040
Don't be a monster, Howard.
Tell the girl.

1234
01:19:54,720 --> 01:19:57,440
Tell me what?

1235
01:19:57,520 --> 01:19:59,480
Oh, you poor kid.

1236
01:20:00,520 --> 01:20:02,600
You can have him.

1237
01:20:02,680 --> 01:20:04,600
You did.

1238
01:20:13,120 --> 01:20:15,120
What?

1239
01:20:18,920 --> 01:20:20,920
Oh, uh,

1240
01:20:25,920 --> 01:20:29,520
we have a history.

1241
01:20:29,600 --> 01:20:32,160
I'm sorry.
Y-You wanted the procedure.

1242
01:20:32,240 --> 01:20:34,400
You...

1243
01:20:34,480 --> 01:20:36,960
You wanted it done...

1244
01:20:37,040 --> 01:20:40,360
so you could get past, uh...

1245
01:20:42,040 --> 01:20:44,040
You could... Yeah.

1246
01:20:45,520 --> 01:20:50,480
Um, I have to, uh,
finish the work in there.

1247
01:20:50,560 --> 01:20:52,560
It's almost morning.

1248
01:20:53,760 --> 01:20:55,760
We'll talk later.

1249
01:20:56,760 --> 01:20:58,680
Okay?

1250
01:21:09,680 --> 01:21:11,600
Hey.

1251
01:21:15,560 --> 01:21:17,560
Let me give you a lift home.

1252
01:21:27,120 --> 01:21:29,680
Fuck this thing. Damn it.

1253
01:21:29,760 --> 01:21:33,360
Hi.
Hi.

1254
01:21:33,440 --> 01:21:37,360
Didn't figure you'd show your face
around me again.

1255
01:21:37,440 --> 01:21:40,680
I guess I thought
you were... humiliated.

1256
01:21:40,760 --> 01:21:42,720
You did run away,
after all.

1257
01:21:42,760 --> 01:21:45,560
I just needed to see ya.

1258
01:21:45,600 --> 01:21:47,920
Yeah?

1259
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,720
I'd like to, um,

1260
01:21:50,800 --> 01:21:53,760
take you out or something.

1261
01:21:53,840 --> 01:21:56,400
You're married.

1262
01:21:56,440 --> 01:21:58,880
Not yet. Not married.

1263
01:21:58,960 --> 01:22:00,880
No, I'm not married, no.

1264
01:22:00,960 --> 01:22:04,000
Look, man,
I'm telling you right off the bat
I'm high maintenance,

1265
01:22:04,080 --> 01:22:08,640
so I'm not gonna tiptoe
around your marriage...

1266
01:22:08,720 --> 01:22:11,040
or whatever it is
you've got going there.

1267
01:22:11,120 --> 01:22:14,240
If you wanna be with me,
you're with me.

1268
01:22:14,320 --> 01:22:16,480
Okay.

1269
01:22:16,560 --> 01:22:19,440
Too many guys think I'm a concept,
or I complete them,

1270
01:22:19,520 --> 01:22:22,320
or I'm gonna make them alive.

1271
01:22:22,400 --> 01:22:26,000
But I'm just a fucked-up girl
who's looking for
my own peace of mind.

1272
01:22:26,080 --> 01:22:30,760
Don't assign me yours.
I remember that speech
really well.

1273
01:22:30,840 --> 01:22:34,320
I had you pegged, didn't I?
You had the whole
human race pegged.

1274
01:22:34,400 --> 01:22:36,400
Hmm. Probably.

1275
01:22:38,560 --> 01:22:40,880
I still thought you were
gonna save my life,

1276
01:22:40,920 --> 01:22:42,880
even after that.

1277
01:22:42,920 --> 01:22:46,320
Mmm. I know.

1278
01:22:48,680 --> 01:22:50,680
It would be different...

1279
01:22:51,800 --> 01:22:54,200
if we could just give it
another go around.

1280
01:22:58,200 --> 01:23:00,560
Remember me.

1281
01:23:00,640 --> 01:23:02,600
Try your best.

1282
01:23:04,960 --> 01:23:06,880
Maybe we can.

1283
01:23:38,160 --> 01:23:41,080
Okay, so just tell me
what you remember,

1284
01:23:41,160 --> 01:23:43,760
and, uh, then we'll
take it from there.

1285
01:23:43,840 --> 01:23:46,080
Okay.

1286
01:23:46,120 --> 01:23:49,040
I liked you immediately.

1287
01:23:49,120 --> 01:23:51,600
You didn't
come on to me at all.

1288
01:23:51,680 --> 01:23:54,680
I liked that.

1289
01:23:54,760 --> 01:23:57,720
I was so tongue-tied
around you at fixirst.

1290
01:23:57,760 --> 01:24:00,440
I wanted you to think
I was smart.

1291
01:24:01,640 --> 01:24:04,000
I couldn't wait
to come to work.

1292
01:24:04,040 --> 01:24:07,560
I had these fantasies
of us being married...

1293
01:24:07,640 --> 01:24:11,000
and having kids and... just...

1294
01:24:11,040 --> 01:24:13,760
Oh, Howie, I can't do this.

1295
01:24:13,840 --> 01:24:16,440
We agreed it's for the best, Mary.

1296
01:24:16,480 --> 01:24:18,960
Yeah, I know.

1297
01:24:19,040 --> 01:24:20,960
Oh, God.

1298
01:24:21,320 --> 01:24:23,400
I'll take the bottom and you...
Uh-uh-uh! No, no, no. Here.

1299
01:24:23,480 --> 01:24:25,400
I can take that.
So you want me to carry that?

1300
01:24:25,480 --> 01:24:27,960
Help me with that.
Can you get the cooler?
Honey, the cooler is...

1301
01:24:28,040 --> 01:24:30,640
That's light, huh?
Oh, I can get that.
You can get it.

1302
01:24:30,720 --> 01:24:32,640
No, no, no, no!

1303
01:24:32,720 --> 01:24:34,880
Don't take anything.
I can take the plane.

1304
01:24:34,960 --> 01:24:37,960
Put the thing up.
Put the gate back up.

1305
01:24:40,200 --> 01:24:42,920
This is the day we met.

1306
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:46,200
You were down by the surf.
I couldjust make you out
in the distance.

1307
01:24:46,280 --> 01:24:48,400
I remember being drawn to you
even then.

1308
01:24:48,480 --> 01:24:52,600
I thought, "Wow, how odd.
I'm drawn to someone's back. "

1309
01:24:54,360 --> 01:24:57,520
You were in that orange sweatshirt
that I would come to know so well...

1310
01:24:57,600 --> 01:24:59,560
and even hate, eventually.

1311
01:24:59,640 --> 01:25:03,640
At the time I thought,
"How cool! An orange sweatshirt."

1312
01:25:03,720 --> 01:25:06,440
Hi there.

1313
01:25:06,520 --> 01:25:08,440
Hi.

1314
01:25:08,520 --> 01:25:11,440
I saw you sitting over here...

1315
01:25:11,520 --> 01:25:13,440
by yourself,

1316
01:25:13,520 --> 01:25:16,440
and I thought, "Thank God.

1317
01:25:16,480 --> 01:25:19,280
Someone normal
who doesn't know how to interact
at these things either."

1318
01:25:19,360 --> 01:25:21,480
Yeah.

1319
01:25:21,560 --> 01:25:24,600
I don't ever know what to say.

1320
01:25:24,680 --> 01:25:27,400
I'm Clementine.

1321
01:25:27,480 --> 01:25:30,640
Can I borrow a piece
of your chicken?

1322
01:25:30,720 --> 01:25:32,920
And then you just took it...

1323
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:35,520
without waiting for an answer.

1324
01:25:39,080 --> 01:25:41,560
It was so intimate,

1325
01:25:41,640 --> 01:25:44,760
like we were already lovers.

1326
01:25:44,840 --> 01:25:47,640
I'm Joel.

1327
01:25:47,720 --> 01:25:49,880
Hi, Joel.

1328
01:25:49,960 --> 01:25:53,200
So, no jokes about my name.

1329
01:25:53,280 --> 01:25:57,720
You mean like...
Oh, my darling, oh, my darling
Oh, my darling Clementine

1330
01:25:57,800 --> 01:26:00,280
Huckleberry Hound,
that sort of thing?

1331
01:26:00,360 --> 01:26:02,400
Yeah. Like that.

1332
01:26:02,480 --> 01:26:04,400
Oh, no jokes. No jokes.

1333
01:26:04,480 --> 01:26:08,200
One of my favorite things when I was a kid
was my Huckleberry Hound doll.

1334
01:26:08,280 --> 01:26:10,280
Oh.

1335
01:26:12,200 --> 01:26:14,560
I think your name is magical.

1336
01:26:17,440 --> 01:26:19,760
This is it, Joel.

1337
01:26:19,840 --> 01:26:22,000
It's gonna be gone soon.

1338
01:26:24,160 --> 01:26:26,480
I know.

1339
01:26:26,560 --> 01:26:28,480
What do we do?

1340
01:26:30,880 --> 01:26:33,400
Enjoy it.

1341
01:26:50,040 --> 01:26:52,360
You married?
No.

1342
01:26:52,440 --> 01:26:55,040
Let's move into
this neighborhood!

1343
01:26:55,120 --> 01:26:57,040
I do sort of live
with someone though.

1344
01:26:57,080 --> 01:27:00,440
Male or female?
What?

1345
01:27:00,520 --> 01:27:02,960
Female. Female.

1346
01:27:05,080 --> 01:27:08,600
At least I'm not barking
up the wrong tree.

1347
01:27:11,360 --> 01:27:15,360
You know these people?
No, of course not.
Come on.

1348
01:27:16,360 --> 01:27:18,320
They might have a dog.

1349
01:27:18,360 --> 01:27:22,040
There's no dog.

1350
01:27:22,120 --> 01:27:24,120
What are you doing?

1351
01:27:24,200 --> 01:27:27,440
It's freezing out.
I can't believe this.

1352
01:27:27,520 --> 01:27:30,480
Hoo-hoo!

1353
01:27:30,560 --> 01:27:34,400
- Clementine!
- There we go. Whoo-hoo!

1354
01:27:41,120 --> 01:27:43,720
Come on, man.
The water's fine.

1355
01:27:43,800 --> 01:27:46,920
Nobody's coming here tonight.
Believe me.

1356
01:27:49,680 --> 01:27:51,600
It's dark.

1357
01:27:51,680 --> 01:27:55,680
So, uh, what's
your girlfriend's name?

1358
01:27:55,760 --> 01:27:59,000
Naomi, but we're not really...
I mean...

1359
01:27:59,040 --> 01:28:01,440
We're...
Whatever.

1360
01:28:01,520 --> 01:28:05,600
So this is great.
Now I can look for, um,
candles, matches...

1361
01:28:05,680 --> 01:28:08,160
and the liquor cabinet.

1362
01:28:08,240 --> 01:28:11,480
Oh, God.

1363
01:28:16,080 --> 01:28:17,920
I think we should go.

1364
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,600
There's no phone line.
What?

1365
01:28:20,680 --> 01:28:22,840
I think we should go.
Why?

1366
01:28:22,920 --> 01:28:25,520
It's our house...
just for tonight.

1367
01:28:25,600 --> 01:28:28,560
We are "David and Ruth Laskin."

1368
01:28:29,680 --> 01:28:32,120
Which one do you want to be?
Uh...

1369
01:28:32,200 --> 01:28:35,680
I prefer to be Ruth,
but I can be flexible.

1370
01:28:37,200 --> 01:28:40,520
What are you do...

1371
01:28:40,600 --> 01:28:42,840
Alcohol!
Oh, boy.

1372
01:28:42,880 --> 01:28:45,480
So, are you okay with wine?

1373
01:28:45,560 --> 01:28:48,240
I don't know.
Well, you choose the wine.

1374
01:28:48,320 --> 01:28:52,520
I'm gonna go find the bedroom
and slip into something more... Ruth.

1375
01:28:55,960 --> 01:28:58,720
I'm Ruth-less at the moment.
I really should go.

1376
01:29:00,440 --> 01:29:03,560
I've gotta catch my ride.

1377
01:29:05,440 --> 01:29:07,920
So go.

1378
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:10,080
I did.

1379
01:29:10,160 --> 01:29:13,040
I thought maybe you were a nut,

1380
01:29:13,080 --> 01:29:15,880
but you were exciting.

1381
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:18,920
I wish you'd stayed.

1382
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:21,680
I wish I'd stayed too.
Now I wish I'd stayed.

1383
01:29:21,760 --> 01:29:24,840
I wish I'd done a lot of things.

1384
01:29:24,920 --> 01:29:27,240
Oh, God, I wish I had...

1385
01:29:31,200 --> 01:29:34,360
I wish I'd stayed. I do.

1386
01:29:34,400 --> 01:29:38,960
Well, I came back downstairs,
and you were gone.
I walked out. I walked out the door.

1387
01:29:39,040 --> 01:29:41,880
Why?
I don't know.
I felt like a scared little kid.

1388
01:29:41,960 --> 01:29:45,280
I was like...
It was above my head.
I don't know.

1389
01:29:45,360 --> 01:29:47,280
You were scared?

1390
01:29:47,360 --> 01:29:49,280
Yeah.

1391
01:29:50,320 --> 01:29:52,960
Thought you knew that
about me.

1392
01:29:53,040 --> 01:29:57,040
I ran back to the bonfixire,
trying to outrun my humiliation, I think.

1393
01:29:57,120 --> 01:30:00,720
Was it something I said?
Yeah.

1394
01:30:03,520 --> 01:30:05,920
You said, "So go"...

1395
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:08,440
with such disdain, you know?

1396
01:30:08,520 --> 01:30:11,160
Oh, I'm sorry.
It's okay.

1397
01:30:16,720 --> 01:30:18,640
Joely?

1398
01:30:18,720 --> 01:30:21,600
What if you stayed this time?

1399
01:30:24,280 --> 01:30:26,880
I walked out the door.

1400
01:30:26,960 --> 01:30:28,920
There's no memory left.

1401
01:30:28,960 --> 01:30:32,080
Come back and make up
a good-bye, at least.

1402
01:30:32,160 --> 01:30:34,120
Let's pretend we had one.

1403
01:30:45,200 --> 01:30:47,720
Bye, Joel.

1404
01:30:47,800 --> 01:30:49,720
I love you.

1405
01:30:49,800 --> 01:30:54,040
Meet me in Montauk.

1406
01:30:57,720 --> 01:31:01,920
I didn't crash the plane.
The plane crashed.
I didn't crash the plane.

1407
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:06,080
You were operating the plane
with the remote control,
and then it crashed.

1408
01:31:06,160 --> 01:31:08,520
It was fucking windy.
Come on, man.

1409
01:31:08,560 --> 01:31:10,560
You're stoned, and you're driving.

1410
01:31:10,600 --> 01:31:13,160
Yeah, the pot balances it out.
The pot brings you back up.

1411
01:31:13,240 --> 01:31:15,760
That's why I smoke it.
If I'm going to be drinking,
then I'll smoke it.

1412
01:31:15,840 --> 01:31:19,480
It does.
That's a medical fact.

1413
01:31:19,560 --> 01:31:22,000
It was proven
on the Science Network.

1414
01:31:22,040 --> 01:31:24,480
Honey, just watch the road.
I can't see shit.

1415
01:31:27,080 --> 01:31:30,040
I saw you talking
to somebody pretty.

1416
01:31:30,120 --> 01:31:32,960
She was nice.
Yeah, man. Who was that?

1417
01:31:35,080 --> 01:31:38,360
She was, um, just a girl.

1418
01:31:45,880 --> 01:31:48,760
Okay.

1419
01:32:24,240 --> 01:32:27,000
So I gotta...
I gotta drop the van off.

1420
01:32:27,080 --> 01:32:29,200
Thanks, Stan. Thanks.

1421
01:32:29,240 --> 01:32:32,600
We'll talk.

1422
01:33:50,600 --> 01:33:52,600
Hey!

1423
01:33:53,680 --> 01:33:55,600
Hey.

1424
01:33:57,080 --> 01:33:59,800
You got a lot
of your stuff there, I see.
Yeah, that's right. My stuff.

1425
01:33:59,880 --> 01:34:03,320
I take it you're not coming back.
I wouldn't come back if I was you either.

1426
01:34:03,400 --> 01:34:07,120
Do you swear you didn't know?
L-I swear.

1427
01:34:07,200 --> 01:34:10,800
So you didn't do the erasing?
Of course not. God, no.

1428
01:34:10,840 --> 01:34:13,040
And you never even suspected
we were together?

1429
01:34:13,120 --> 01:34:17,360
Once, maybe.

1430
01:34:17,440 --> 01:34:20,440
I was coming back from a job,
and you were at his car.

1431
01:34:20,520 --> 01:34:23,080
I saw you two talking.

1432
01:34:23,160 --> 01:34:26,920
So I waved to you,
and you giggled, you know.

1433
01:34:26,960 --> 01:34:29,280
How'd I look?

1434
01:34:30,720 --> 01:34:32,640
You looked happy.

1435
01:34:32,720 --> 01:34:34,960
Happy with a secret.

1436
01:34:36,400 --> 01:34:38,320
And after that?

1437
01:34:38,400 --> 01:34:41,560
I never saw you two together
again like that, so I just...

1438
01:34:41,640 --> 01:34:45,320
I don't know. I just figured
I was imagining things.

1439
01:35:04,240 --> 01:35:07,280
Aah!
Montauk train
now boarding on track "B."All aboard.

1440
01:35:10,120 --> 01:35:12,600
I really like you, Mary Svevo.

1441
01:35:13,800 --> 01:35:16,080
You know that?

1442
01:35:26,120 --> 01:35:28,120
Thanks.

1443
01:36:01,720 --> 01:36:03,840
Let me get my toothbrush.

1444
01:36:03,920 --> 01:36:06,360
Yeah. Just...

1445
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:21,560
Where are you, Clem?
I'm worried.

1446
01:36:21,640 --> 01:36:26,000
La-la-la-la-la.
I feel like you're mad at me,
and I don't know what I did.

1447
01:36:26,080 --> 01:36:28,840
What did I do?

1448
01:36:28,880 --> 01:36:31,360
I love you so much.

1449
01:36:31,440 --> 01:36:33,440
I'll do anything
to make you happy.

1450
01:36:33,520 --> 01:36:35,760
Tell me what you want me to do,
and I'll do it.

1451
01:36:35,840 --> 01:36:39,600
Listen, I'm gonna stop by this morning
just to make sure you're okay.

1452
01:36:39,680 --> 01:36:41,600
Oh. Whew.

1453
01:36:52,400 --> 01:36:55,600
Vámonos, señor.

1454
01:36:55,680 --> 01:36:58,840
L-I had a really nice time
last night.

1455
01:36:58,920 --> 01:37:01,560
Nice?

1456
01:37:01,640 --> 01:37:04,880
I had the best fucking night
of my entire fucking life...

1457
01:37:04,920 --> 01:37:06,880
last night.

1458
01:37:06,920 --> 01:37:08,920
That's better.

1459
01:37:12,040 --> 01:37:16,240
This is weird.
To all patients
of Dr. Howard Mierzwiak.

1460
01:37:16,320 --> 01:37:19,800
My name is Mary Svevo.
"We've met,
but you don't remember me.

1461
01:37:19,880 --> 01:37:24,320
I worked for a company you hired
to have part of your memory erased."

1462
01:37:24,400 --> 01:37:26,920
I have since decided
that this is a horrible...
Some kind of teaser ad or something.

1463
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:31,560
In order to correct this,
I'm sending everyone's fixile back to them.

1464
01:37:31,640 --> 01:37:35,240
My name is Clementine Kruczynski.

1465
01:37:35,280 --> 01:37:38,040
I'm here to erase Joel Barish.

1466
01:37:38,080 --> 01:37:40,320
What is this?
I don't know.

1467
01:37:40,400 --> 01:37:45,000
He's boring.
Is that enough reason
to erase someone?

1468
01:37:45,080 --> 01:37:48,760
I've been thinking lately
how I was before and how I am now,

1469
01:37:48,840 --> 01:37:50,760
and it's like he changed me.

1470
01:37:50,840 --> 01:37:54,600
I feel like I'm always pissy now.
I don't like myself when I'm with him.
I don't like myself anymore.

1471
01:37:54,680 --> 01:37:59,280
I can't stand to even look at him.
That pathetic, wimpy, apologetic smile.

1472
01:37:59,360 --> 01:38:02,560
- That sort of wounded puppy shit
he does, you know?
- What are you doing?

1473
01:38:02,640 --> 01:38:05,040
I'm not doing anything.
The bloom is certainly
fucking off the rose at this point.

1474
01:38:05,120 --> 01:38:08,120
- Are you screwing with me?
- No!

1475
01:38:08,200 --> 01:38:10,640
- You are screwing with me.
- Joel, I'm not!

1476
01:38:10,680 --> 01:38:15,080
- You clearly are.
- Look, let's just take a minute and...

1477
01:38:43,720 --> 01:38:45,680
Patrick, get the fuck away.

1478
01:38:45,720 --> 01:38:48,120
Oh, sweetheart...
Get the fuck away from me!

1479
01:38:48,200 --> 01:38:51,440
Can we talk about it?
No! Get the fuck away!

1480
01:39:23,720 --> 01:39:25,960
Joel Barish.

1481
01:39:26,040 --> 01:39:28,800
Hey, Clementine.
Hey.

1482
01:39:28,880 --> 01:39:32,120
Nice to see you. Yeah.

1483
01:39:33,120 --> 01:39:35,040
Yeah.

1484
01:39:35,120 --> 01:39:37,120
Really very educated.

1485
01:39:37,200 --> 01:39:40,640
I mean, she's smart, I think,
but not educated.

1486
01:39:40,680 --> 01:39:43,600
I couldn't really talk to her
about books, you know?

1487
01:39:43,640 --> 01:39:47,080
She's more of
a magazine-reading girl.

1488
01:39:47,160 --> 01:39:50,560
Her vocabulary leaves
something to be desired.

1489
01:39:50,640 --> 01:39:53,280
Sometimes...
I was embarrassed in public...

1490
01:39:53,360 --> 01:39:55,360
Hi.
Because she would pronounce...

1491
01:39:55,440 --> 01:39:58,200
library "libary."
Hi.

1492
01:39:58,280 --> 01:40:01,400
Libary. Libary.

1493
01:40:01,480 --> 01:40:03,400
Look what I found.

1494
01:40:03,480 --> 01:40:07,800
I think if there's
a truly seductive quality
about Clementine,

1495
01:40:07,880 --> 01:40:11,560
it's that her personality promises
to take you out of the mundane.

1496
01:40:12,920 --> 01:40:15,240
You made me look skinny.

1497
01:40:15,320 --> 01:40:17,880
Amazing, burning meteorite...

1498
01:40:17,960 --> 01:40:22,240
will carry you to another world
where things are exciting.

1499
01:40:22,320 --> 01:40:25,360
But what you quickly learn
is that...

1500
01:40:25,440 --> 01:40:28,280
it's really an elaborate ruse.

1501
01:40:28,320 --> 01:40:30,320
I'm sorry I yelled at you.

1502
01:40:31,920 --> 01:40:34,680
It's okay.
So flashy
in a kind of obvious way.

1503
01:40:36,360 --> 01:40:38,920
But still, it seduces you.
Joel, I really like you.

1504
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:41,240
I hate that I said
mean things about you.

1505
01:40:41,320 --> 01:40:45,760
- Let me turn this off, okay?
- Hey, it's... it's only fair.

1506
01:40:47,120 --> 01:40:49,080
Where's the real Clementine?

1507
01:40:49,160 --> 01:40:52,280
I mean, the whole thing with the hair...
it's all bullshit.

1508
01:40:52,360 --> 01:40:55,080
- I really like your hair.
- Thank you.

1509
01:40:55,160 --> 01:40:57,400
I really like your hair.
Thank you.

1510
01:40:57,480 --> 01:40:59,400
I do.
The world's a goddamn mess.

1511
01:40:59,480 --> 01:41:03,080
Is it some kind of a revolt?
Change your hair color.
You want a drink or something?

1512
01:41:03,160 --> 01:41:05,920
Do you have any whiskey?

1513
01:41:05,960 --> 01:41:11,280
No, I don't think her sex
is... motivated.

1514
01:41:11,360 --> 01:41:14,320
I saw it clearly
the last night we were together.

1515
01:41:14,400 --> 01:41:17,800
It wasn't sex.
It was just sad.

1516
01:41:17,880 --> 01:41:20,960
Hey. Sorry.
I thought there was more.

1517
01:41:21,040 --> 01:41:24,680
The only way Clem thinks
she can get people to like her...

1518
01:41:24,760 --> 01:41:27,600
is to fuck 'em...

1519
01:41:27,680 --> 01:41:31,880
or at least dangle the possibility
of getting fucked in front of'em.

1520
01:41:31,960 --> 01:41:34,920
And she's so desperate
and insecure...

1521
01:41:34,960 --> 01:41:39,800
that she'll, sooner or later,
go around fucking everybody.

1522
01:41:39,880 --> 01:41:42,880
I don't do that.
I wouldn't think that
about you.

1523
01:41:42,960 --> 01:41:45,880
- Because I don't.
- I know.

1524
01:41:45,960 --> 01:41:49,160
Because it really hurts me
that you said that
because I don't do that.

1525
01:41:49,240 --> 01:41:52,360
I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry about all this.
I'm gonna... go.

1526
01:41:52,400 --> 01:41:57,240
I'm a little confused.
I don't really think I can be here.

1527
01:42:01,360 --> 01:42:05,040
Um... bye.

1528
01:42:05,080 --> 01:42:07,720
Bye.
I thought I knew her so well.

1529
01:42:07,800 --> 01:42:11,400
It was nice meeting you and all.
But I don't know her at all.

1530
01:42:12,720 --> 01:42:16,080
What a loss to spend
that much time with someone,

1531
01:42:16,160 --> 01:42:20,040
only to fixind out
that she's a stranger.

1532
01:42:23,360 --> 01:42:25,360
Wait.

1533
01:42:27,040 --> 01:42:28,960
What?
I don't know.

1534
01:42:29,040 --> 01:42:31,200
Just wait. Just wait.
What do you want, Joel?

1535
01:42:31,240 --> 01:42:35,800
I don't know.
I want you to wait for...
just a while.

1536
01:42:49,360 --> 01:42:52,040
Okay.
Really?

1537
01:42:52,120 --> 01:42:56,240
I'm not a concept, Joel.
I'm just a fucked-up girl who's looking
for my own peace of mind.

1538
01:42:56,320 --> 01:43:00,240
- I'm not perfect.
- I can't see anything
that I don't like about you.

1539
01:43:00,320 --> 01:43:03,000
Right now I can't.
But you will.
But you will.

1540
01:43:03,080 --> 01:43:06,720
You know, you will think of things,
and I'll get bored with you
and feel trapped...

1541
01:43:06,800 --> 01:43:08,840
because that's what happens
with me.

1542
01:43:10,320 --> 01:43:12,280
Okay.

1543
01:43:15,960 --> 01:43:17,960
Okay.

1544
01:43:22,080 --> 01:43:25,240
Okay.
Okay.

1545
01:43:33,200 --> 01:43:35,400
Change your heart

1546
01:43:38,520 --> 01:43:41,360
Look around you

1547
01:43:47,720 --> 01:43:50,120
Change your heart

1548
01:43:52,720 --> 01:43:55,880
It will astound you

1549
01:44:00,280 --> 01:44:04,080
Now, I need your lovin'

1550
01:44:06,720 --> 01:44:12,120
Like the sunshine

1551
01:44:14,720 --> 01:44:18,840
And everybody's
gotta learn sometime

1552
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:26,000
Everybody's gotta learn
sometime

1553
01:44:29,080 --> 01:44:33,760
Everybody's
gotta learn sometime

1554
01:44:33,840 --> 01:44:36,320
Mm-mm-mm

1555
01:44:50,200 --> 01:44:52,520
Change your heart

1556
01:44:55,520 --> 01:44:58,680
And look around you

1557
01:45:04,040 --> 01:45:06,360
Change your heart

1558
01:45:09,680 --> 01:45:13,160
It will astound you

1559
01:45:16,880 --> 01:45:21,160
I need your lovin'

1560
01:45:23,640 --> 01:45:29,120
Like the sunshine

1561
01:45:31,720 --> 01:45:35,920
And everybody's
gotta learn sometime

1562
01:45:38,960 --> 01:45:43,160
Everybody's gotta learn
sometime

1563
01:45:46,080 --> 01:45:50,800
Everybody's
gotta learn sometime

1564
01:45:50,880 --> 01:45:53,880
Mm-mm-mm

1565
01:45:58,760 --> 01:46:02,760
Everybody's gotta learn

1566
01:46:05,800 --> 01:46:09,800
Everybody's gotta learn sometime

1567
01:46:12,920 --> 01:46:17,400
Everybody's gotta learn sometime

1568
01:46:17,480 --> 01:46:20,400
Mm-mm-mm
